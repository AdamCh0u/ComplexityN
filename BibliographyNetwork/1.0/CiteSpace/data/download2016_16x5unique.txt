TI What would dense atmospheric observation networks bring to the

AB Cities currently covering only a very small portion ( < aEuro-3aEuro-%) of the world's land surface directly release to the atmosphere about 44aEuro-% of global energy-related CO2, but they are associated with 71-76aEuro-% of CO2 emissions from global final energy use. Although many cities have set voluntary climate plans, their CO2 emissions are not evaluated by the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) procedures that play a key role for market- or policy-based mitigation actions. Here we analyze the potential of a monitoring tool that could support the development of such procedures at the city scale. It is based on an atmospheric inversion method that exploits inventory data and continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements from a network of stations within and around cities to estimate city CO2 emissions. This monitoring tool is configured for the quantification of the total and sectoral CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area (similar to aEuro-12 million inhabitants and 11.4aEuro-TgC emitted in 2010) during the month of January 2011. Its performances are evaluated in terms of uncertainty reduction based on observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). They are analyzed as a function of the number of sampling sites (measuring at 25aEuro-maEuro-a.g.l.) and as a function of the network design. The instruments presently used to measure CO2 concentrations at research stations are expensive (typically similar to aEuro-EURaEuro-50aEuro-k per sensor), which has limited the few current pilot city networks to around 10 sites. Larger theoretical networks are studied here to assess the potential benefit of hypothetical operational lower-cost sensors. The setup of our inversion system is based on a number of diagnostics and assumptions from previous city-scale inversion experiences with real data. We find that, given our assumptions underlying the configuration of the OSSEs, with 10 stations only the uncertainty for the total city CO2 emission during 1 month is significantly reduced by the inversion by similar to aEuro-42aEuro-%. It can be further reduced by extending the network, e.g., from 10 to 70 stations, which is promising for MRV applications in the Paris metropolitan area. With 70 stations, the uncertainties in the inverted emissions are reduced significantly over those obtained using 10 stations: by 32aEuro-% for commercial and residential buildings, by 33aEuro-% for road transport, by 18aEuro-% for the production of energy by power plants, and by 31aEuro-% for total emissions. These results indicate that such a high number of stations would be likely required for the monitoring of sectoral emissions in Paris using this observation-model framework. They demonstrate some high potential that atmospheric inversions can contribute to the monitoring and/or the verification of city CO2 emissions (baseline) and CO2 emission reductions (commitments) and the advantage that could be brought by the current developments of lower-cost medium precision (LCMP) sensors.

AB Due to the rapid urbanization, cities have become a hot topic. Extensive complex phenomena, such as scaling laws with respect to population, morphology, spatial distribution within cities have been revealed and validated by the empirical studies. Yet there's still no clear answer to the question that what's the underlying mechanism responsible for these observed complex phenomena. Most of previous studies only focus on one aspect of the city. However, focusing on only one aspect may lose the whole picture of it. Based on a very simple "matching growth" rule and two more simple assumptions, which are all performed locally, we propose a simple model which can derive most of observed macro scaling relations and spatial distribution. All these theoretical deductions can be well supported by empirical data. And the consistency between the exponents of different cumulative spatial distribution may indicates that the city really follows the rules we assumed.

TI Comparison of social structures within cities of very different sizes
SO ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
DE social networks; modularity; scaling
AB People make a city, making each city as unique as the combination of its inhabitants. However, some cities are similar and some cities are inimitable. We examine the social structure of 10 different cities using Twitter data. Each city is decomposed to its communities. We show that in many cases one city can be thought of as an amalgamation of communities from another city. For example, we find the social network of Manchester is very similar to the social network of a virtual city of the same size, where the virtual city is composed of communities from the Bristol network. However, we cannot create Bristol from Manchester since Bristol contains communities with a social structure that are not present in Manchester. Some cities, such as Leeds, are outliers. That is, Leeds contains a particularly wide range of communities, meaning we cannot build a similar city from communities outside of Leeds. Comparing communities from different cities, and building virtual cities that are comparable to real cities, is a novel approach to understand social networks. This has implications when using social media to inform or advise residents of a city.

TI Uncovering Urban Temporal Patterns from Geo-Tagged Photography
SO PLOS ONE
ID MOBILE PHONE DATA; ATTRACTIVENESS; CITIES
AB We live in a world where digital trails of different forms of human activities compose big urban data, allowing us to detect many aspects of how people experience the city in which they live or come to visit. In this study we propose to enhance urban planning by taking into a consideration individual preferences using information from an unconventional big data source: dataset of geo-tagged photographs that people take in cities which we then use as a measure of urban attractiveness. We discover and compare a temporal behavior of residents and visitors in ten most photographed cities in the world. Looking at the periodicity in urban attractiveness, the results show that the strongest periodic patterns for visitors are usually weekly or monthly. Moreover, by dividing cities into two groups based on which continent they belong to (i.e., North America or Europe), it can be concluded that unlike European cities, behavior of visitors in the US cities in general is similar to the behavior of their residents. Finally, we apply two indices, called "dilatation attractiveness index" and "dilatation index", to our dataset which tell us the spatial and temporal attractiveness pulsations in the city. The proposed methodology is not only important for urban planning, but also does support various business and public stakeholder decision processes, concentrated for example around the question how to attract more visitors to the city or estimate the impact of special events organized there.

TI Rich and Poor Cities in Europe. An Urban Scaling Approach to Mapping the
   European Economic Transition
SO PLOS ONE
ID GROWTH; SIZE
AB Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling. We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been demonstrated that GMP alpha Y Ypop(beta) with beta always greater than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of cities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, beta = 1 over the whole the period, while for post-communist cities beta > 1 and increases from similar to 1.2 to similar to 1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the convergence of postcommunist European cities to open and liberal economies. We propose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political conditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic growth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and urban economics.
