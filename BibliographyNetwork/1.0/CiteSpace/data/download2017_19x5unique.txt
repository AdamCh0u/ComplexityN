AB Rapid worldwide urbanization is at once the main cause and, potentially, the main solution to global sustainable development challenges. The growth of cities is typically associated with increases in socioeconomic productivity, but it also creates strong inequalities. Despite a growing body of evidence characterizing these heterogeneities in developed urban areas, not much is known systematically about their most extreme forms in developing cities and their consequences for sustainability. Here, we characterize the general patterns of income and access to services in a large number of developing cities, with an emphasis on an extensive, high-resolution analysis of the urban areas of Brazil and South Africa. We use detailed census data to construct sustainable development indices in hundreds of thousands of neighborhoods and show that their statistics are scale-dependent and point to the critical role of large cities in creating higher average incomes and greater access to services within their national context. We then quantify the general statistical trajectory toward universal basic service provision at different scales to show that it is characterized by varying levels of inequality, with initial increases in access being typically accompanied by growing disparities over characteristic spatial scales. These results demonstrate how extensions of these methods to other goals and data can be used over time and space to produce a simple but general quantitative assessment of progress toward internationally agreed sustainable development goals.

AB In this paper, we empirically analyze the spatial distribution of Chinese cities using a method based on triangle transition. This method uses a regular triangle mapping from the observed cities and its three neighboring cities to analyze their distribution of mapping positions. We find that obvious center-gathering tendency for the relationship between cities and its nearest three cities, indicating the spatial competition between cities. Moreover, we observed the competitive trends between neighboring cities with similar economic volume, and the remarkable cooperative tendency between neighboring cities with large difference on economy. The threshold of the ratio of the two cities' economic volume on the transition from competition to cooperation is about 1.2. These findings are helpful in the understanding of the cities economic relationship, especially in the study of competition and cooperation between cities.

TI Is there more traffic congestion in larger cities? -Scaling analysis of
   the 101 largest US urban centers-
SO TRANSPORT POLICY
DE Urban congestion; Total delay hours; Excess CO2 emission; Excess fuel
   consumption; Superlinear relationship; Sublinear relationship
ID ENERGY-CONSUMPTION; TRAVEL; DENSITY; POLICY
AB Over the past three decades, urban congestion has become more costly in terms of time, money, and fuel. For the top 101 largest US urban centers, congestion generated 4.8 billion hours of travel delays in 2011, up from 1.1 billion hours in 1982. Congestion also required 8.419 million cubic meters of excess fuel consumption in 2011, up from 1.73 million cubic meters in 1982. Filially, the excess CO2 emitted from congestion amounted to 19.524 billion kilograms in 2011, up from 3.94 billion kilograms in 1982. We examined the scaling relationships between the population sizes of urban centers and traffic congestion for four subgroups of urban centers with varying population sizes. We found that scaling relationships were superlinear for most subgroups. However, for the subgroup comprising mega cities with populations of over 3 million people, the relationship was linear.
   The varying scaling relationships we found for cities with different population sizes may resolve the contradictory scaling results reported in the extant literature. Several other implications from our findings are also discussed.

ID CITIES; CONSUMPTION; INNOVATION; EFFICIENCY; DENSITY
AB Existing urban transport systems have fundamentally shaped our modern urban economies and societies, however, disruptive technologies, as fundamental as recent ICT disruptions, threaten major change. Urban transport disruptions therefore present a unique challenge and opportunity for planners and policy-makers to influence and shape outcomes for society. The role of urban planners and policy-makers in future transport systems will become increasingly important as mobility disruptions start to radically transform transport systems. Without sensible and informed public policy, future urban mobility disruptions have the potential to lead to a series of non-optimal outcomes, of which some may result in transport systems functioning worse than they do at present. This paper explores the key urban mobility disruptions of: vehicle electrification, autonomous vehicles, and the sharing economy within the context of increasing urban density, to explore what non-optimal outcomes may occur if not all four of these factors are appropriately supported.

SO RESEARCH & POLITICS
DE Fundraising; social networks; campaigns; spatial models
ID INNOVATION
AB We examine the social antecedents of contributing to campaigns, with a particular focus on the role of population density and social networking opportunities. Using 10 years of US campaign contribution data from the Federal Election Commission and a national survey of party leaders, we find that recruiting contributors is easier in a densely populated region, where the daily opportunity of individuals being exposed to the same information via their social networks is high. Furthermore, the effect of population density is heterogeneous with respect to mobility: if a region has substantial commuting outflow, the chance of being mobilized from the place of residence decreases, but the chance of mobilization in their place of work increases. This analysis also reveals differences between political parties. Democrats are more dependent on social networking in population dense areas. This difference in the importance of social networking opportunities present in geographical space helps explain macro-level patterns in party fundraising.
