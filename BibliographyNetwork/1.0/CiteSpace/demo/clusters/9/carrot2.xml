<title>The GWP-Chart: An environmental tool for guiding urban planning processes. Application to concrete sidewalks</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cities.2011.01.003</url>
<snippet>The systematized study of urban morphology has led to the development of integrated tools based on the knowledge of the relation between physical density and urban form. These tools do help planners and decision makers; however, environmental data is rarely included in them. This paper presents the GWP-Chart, a method that combines urban planning tools with environmental data, obtained through the use of the life cycle assessment (LCA) results. In order to explain its use, three urban fabrics have been selected. According to their morphology and their ground space index (GSI) and public space ratio (PSR) values, the contribution of the sidewalk subsystem to the global impact per square meter of urban development can be quantified and communicated. The GWP-Chart is applicable to all types of urban fabrics and scales (street or square, island, fabric or district), as well as adaptable to any urban infrastructure or subsystem and can be extended to other environmental impacts. Its advantages lie in its accurateness, adaptability and ease of interpretation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

<title>Earth Stewardship: science for action to sustain the human-earth system</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES11-00166.1</url>
<snippet>Human activities affect Earth's life support systems so profoundly as to threaten many of the ecological services that are essential to society. To address this challenge, a new science agenda is needed that integrates people with the rest of nature to help chart a more sustainable trajectory for the relationship between society and the biosphere. This paper describes Earth Stewardship, an initiative of the Ecological Society of America to provide the scientific basis for actively shaping trajectories of social-ecological change to enhance ecosystem resilience and human well-being. Principles for moving toward these goals include simultaneous attention to multiple scales and issues; consideration of both ecological and socioeconomic consequences; alignment of incentives with stewardship behavior; strengthening peoples' connections to valued places; and using demographic transitions as new opportunities for stewardship. Past experience provides guidelines for fostering Earth Stewardship. Early attention to sustainable pathways before problems emerge generally provides more cost-effective solutions than attempting to remediate entrenched problems. Defining sustainable pathways by assessing tradeoffs among alternative options requires careful attention to fine-scale processes, interactions, and feedbacks and to larger-scale controls and constraints. Many opportunities occur locally, through development of practices that match the properties of resources with the needs of their users. Substantial challenges remain at larger scales, including maintaining the diversity, productive capacity, and resilience of nature, which are essential for long-term human welfare. The knowledge needed to inform stewardship requires an interdisciplinary science that draws on the observations, skills, and creativity of a wide range of natural and social scientists, practitioners, and civil society. New questions and solutions will emerge when these groups work together to formulate the issues, design the research, and co-produce the observations, knowledge, and concepts that form the basis for solutions. The goal of Earth Stewardship is not to protect nature from people; rather it is to protect nature for human welfare.

<title>Urban Scaling and Its Deviations: Revealing the Structure of Wealth, Innovation and Crime across Cities</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0013541</url>
<snippet>With urban population increasing dramatically worldwide, cities are playing an increasingly critical role in human societies and the sustainability of the planet. An obstacle to effective policy is the lack of meaningful urban metrics based on a quantitative understanding of cities. Typically, linear per capita indicators are used to characterize and rank cities. However, these implicitly ignore the fundamental role of nonlinear agglomeration integral to the life history of cities. As such, per capita indicators conflate general nonlinear effects, common to all cities, with local dynamics, specific to each city, failing to provide direct measures of the impact of local events and policy. Agglomeration nonlinearities are explicitly manifested by the superlinear power law scaling of most urban socioeconomic indicators with population size, all with similar exponents (similar to 1.15). As a result larger cities are disproportionally the centers of innovation, wealth and crime, all to approximately the same degree. We use these general urban laws to develop new urban metrics that disentangle dynamics at different scales and provide true measures of local urban performance. New rankings of cities and a novel and simpler perspective on urban systems emerge. We find that local urban dynamics display long-term memory, so cities under or outperforming their size expectation maintain such (dis)advantage for decades. Spatiotemporal correlation analyses reveal a novel functional taxonomy of U. S. metropolitan areas that is generally not organized geographically but based instead on common local economic models, innovation strategies and patterns of crime. RI Strumsky, Deborah/F-5795-2013

<title>Diversifying European Agglomerations: Evidence of Urban Population Trends for the 21st Century</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/psp.600</url>
<snippet>The beginning of the 21st century marks the first time in history that more than half of the worlds population lives in urban areas. In Europe, more than 70&#37; of the population lives in urban areas today. This number is likely to increase to 84&#37; by 2050. However, a shift from growth to decline of urban population is already present for a growing number of cities. The paper examines urban population trends for 158 European agglomerations and assesses the dynamics behind one particular development of growth or decline. Using data from 1991 to 2004, we present statistical evidence of diversifying population trajectories for core cities and fringe areas. The quantitative results are contrasted with the widespread accepted cyclical urbanisation model that has been expounded as a theoretical approach to describe previous and future stages of European urban development. The structural approach of the model is discussed because we believe that such concepts do not reflect the dynamics of present urban development in Europe. The paper argues that the urban agglomerations studied do not show a single evolutionary stage of urban development. Rather, we found a coexistence of intensifying suburbanisation and developing reurbanisation, which is mainly driven by younger households. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

<title>Urban policy and governance in a global environment: complex systems, scale mismatches and public participation</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2010.05.008</url>
<snippet>The urbanization process and urban activities generate environmental impacts both within and beyond city boundaries. Urban policy plays an important role in shaping and changing the regional and global linkages of cities. Integrating regional and global environmental concerns into urban policy and management practices remains a challenging issue because of the inherent temporal, spatial and institutional scale mismatch between urban policies and regional and global environmental issues. This paper argues that firstly, urban policy has increasing relevance to regional and global environmental issues, and a systems approach is essential in urban policy making to maximize co-benefit and negotiate trade-offs and secondly, although the current institutional settings in urban policy making are not necessarily best suited for managing these issues, enhanced governance processes such as increased public participation and networking and learning across cities can be effective.

<title>Transition towards sustainable cities: opportunities, constraints, and strategies in planning. A neighbourhood ecodesign case study in Barcelona</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a43551</url>
<snippet>Despite covering only 2.7&#37; of the worlds total surface area, the worlds cities are responsible for 75&#37; of the worlds energy consumption and 80&#37; of greenhouse-gas emissions. For this reason, the redesign of cities is essential in the transition towards sustainability. However, planning and designing sustainable neighbourhoods is not a simple task, given that there is no agreement on what the sustainable settlement should be, nor on how this should be achieved. Furthermore, planners have to strive to achieve a balance between financial, environmental, and social goals, and must deal with multiple actors and stakeholders and with site-specific characteristics. The aim of this work is to describe the key determining factors-both opportunities and constraints-found in the process of designing and planning a neighbourhood, based on a case study in the city of Barcelona. In this practical experiment, led by the authors, the ecodesign methodology was applied on an urban scale in the neighbourhood of Vallbona, Barcelona, which occupies an area of 32.6 ha and will host 2120 dwellings. From this neighbourhood ecodesign exercise, it was found that territorial (urban form, urban fabrics, and density; availability of local resources), financial, legal, and political (local governments wishes and leadership) determinants are the most important. It is concluded that there is no single path to achieve urban sustainability, since the design of neighbourhoods in different locations will lead to different results.

<title>The ecodesign and planning of sustainable neighbourhoods: the Vallbona case study (Barcelona)</title>
<url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/ic.11.069</url>
<snippet>Global sustainability is increasingly an issue of urban sustainability, being essential to encourage more benign trajectories of urbanisation. For this, there is need for a framework that could aid in the process of designing and redesigning (retrofitting) cities. The aim of this paper is to present and describe the methodology of urban ecodesign, which is characterized by a systematic incorporation of environmental life cycle considerations into the design of urban systems. The paper presents a case study of neighbourhood ecodesign from the city of Barcelona (Vallbona neighbourhood). This practical experience shows that the inclusion of sustainability criteria at an early stage of the design and planning of urban systems is the best strategy for environmental protection. In addition; a methodological framework is described in order to provide planners with a structured way of designing urban settlements so as to move towards sustainable urban environments.
