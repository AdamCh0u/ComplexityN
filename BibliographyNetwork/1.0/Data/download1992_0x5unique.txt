AB In this paper, we embark on a preliminary exploration of the settlement geography of South East England, with specific reference to the effect that the green belt has had upon the shape and size of towns comprising this region. In common with several other researchers who have examined the impact of such containment policies, we argue that the green belt is likely to have had a significant effect on the geometry of settlement, distorting the geometry from the urban forms which might have arisen in the absence of such policy. We tackle this problem by hypothesizing four different scaling relations which pertain to size and shape. These are based upon allometric relations which explain population size in terms of built-up area and the urban field within which urban development takes place, and upon geometric relations which explain how the irregularity of the envelope bounding urban settlements is related to the areas of the built-up development and the urban field. Using a unique and only recently available digital data base on the boundaries of settlement in South East England, we show that there are indeed significant differences between settlements which have been subject to green belt policy and those which have not been so affected. In essence, settlements which have been constrained by green belt policy are more irregular and fill less of the space available to them than settlements which are not so constrained. We also note that some caution is required in interpreting these results but that the analysis, which is in its preliminary stages, appears promising and has great potential for exploring the physical efficiency of settlement geometry and the extent to which this is changed through green belt policy.

TI STREET CRIME STRATEGIES - THE CHANGING SCHEMATA OF STREETWALKERS
SO ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR
LA English
DT Article
AB Streetwalkers have unique transactions with the urban environment. They must be aware of the shifting environmental stimuli and react accordingly in order to remain in business and avoid arrests. The transactions and schemata of streetwalkers are explored in light of various sociocultural factors by use of police arrest records, field observations, survey results from arrested prostitutes, a multiple regression, and a multidimensional scaling technique. Women of different races are found to be using similar street crime strategies, however their schemata differ. Black and White streetwalkers appear to work at different times, and sometimes places, during the day. The interrelationships between behavior, space, and time are apparent and reveal the dynamic, multifaceted nature of criminal transactions.

AB This paper describes a PC-package for simulation of bathing water quality. The actual case reported is the beach of Rodvig, SE Zealand, Denmark. The package computes time series and frequency distributions for E.coli, the indicator organism for bathing water quality. Point sources of pollution from combined sewer overflows (CSO) are computed from historical rain series and the existing MOUSE-package (Modelling Of Urban Sewers). Pollution from dry weather flow (DWF) (eg. purification plants) is also included. The bathing water model is based on time series for flow, dispersion and decay and is calibrated from measured frequency distributions in 4 stations within the period 1981-1986. A standard deviation factor STDE  = 2.4 is achieved inbetween measured and computed distributions. Best fit values are obtained for 1) scaling factors eR and es for pollution from CSO and DWF respectively, 2) diffuse (non-point) E.coli pollution ED and 3) dispersion parameters Cb1 and Cb2 in the direction of coastline and vertical hereto. The calibrated model has revealed that an area of 102 ha along the beach exceeds the statistically acceptable quality  line for bathing water. The paper presents 4 proposals for improving the quality by reducing the pollution from CSO and DWF, and/or by using an outfall pipe further into the sea for CSO.

TI FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION - REFORMULATING URBAN-POPULATION DENSITY-FUNCTIONS
SO URBAN STUDIES
LA English
DT Article
ID DIFFUSION-LIMITED AGGREGATION; GROWTH; MODELS
AB In this paper, we argue that the most appropriate form for urban population density models is the inverse power function, contrary to conventional practice, which is largely based upon the negative exponential. We first show that the inverse power function has several theoretical properties which have hitherto gone unremarked in the literature. Our main argument, however, is based on the notion that a density function should describe the extent to which the space available for urban development is filled. To this end, we introduce ideas from urban allometry and fractal geometry to demonstrate that the inverse power model is the only function which embodies the fractal property of self-similarity which we consider to be a basic characteristic of urban form and density. In short, we show that the distance parameter alpha of the inverse power model is a measure of the extent to which space is filled, and that its value is determined by the basic relation D + alpha = 2 where D is the fractal dimension of the city in question. We then test this model using four data sets which measure the density and morphology of the city of Seoul. Using a variety of estimation methods such as loglinear regression, dimensional approximation and entropy-maximising, we estimate dimension and density parameters for 136 variants of the function and its data sets. From these estimates, 125 are within the values hypothesised and this suggests fairly conclusively that the value of the density parameter alpha for the inverse power function should be within the range 0-1 and probably between 0.2 and 0.5. Many related questions are raised by this analysis which will form the subject of future research.
