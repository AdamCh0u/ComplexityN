TI PRIVATE GOVERNMENT FORMATION IN THE DC METROPOLITAN-AREA
SO GROWTH AND CHANGE

ID URBAN
AB This paper examines a variety of quasi-governmental organizations, mandatory homeowners' associations, special service districts, and transportation management associations, recently established in the urban region. Using the Washington, DC metropolitan area as a case study, this paper explores reasons for their development and implications of them for urban governance. It is argued that these organizations marry the concepts of public special districts and public-private partnerships in a process of private government formation. Private governments, it is suggested, are not wholly a private response to the shedding of services by the public sector, the dominant notion of privatization and local state restructuring, but the result of demands emerging ir. the private sector stimulated by social and spatial change. This signals the need to add to the concept of public-driven privatization the process of private initiated change where the resulting goods and services are more fully shaped by the needs of private interests.         The evidence suggests these institutions do not represent a scaling back of the local state as privatization implies, but an extension of state structures in a fundamentally new direction, an extension which could be labeled the parallel state.

AB The focus of this study is people's perception of their housing. The study took place in Ankara, Turkey, during the 1990-1991 academic year. The intention was not to test a particular set of hypotheses but to compare and contrast the lives of people who had migrated to squatter settlements in Ankara with those who had remained in rural settings. The key idea in selecting the two communities was to have a pool of interviewees who were reasonably similar with regard to life experience except for the recent migration of the one group. The migrant group selected was living in a well-established squatter settlement which is located about a 10-15 minute minibus ride south of the city center. The sample of non-migrants came from a rural farming community about an hour drive northwest of Ankara. Data was collected utilizing a questionnaire during interviews conducted in the residents' homes. Questions dealt with both objective issues regarding their housing as well as their evaluations of the quality of their housing.
   The data analysis went through a series of stages, each stage reflecting another way of viewing the information. First, each set of evaluative variables and objective variables was analyzed, utilizing factor analysis and multidimensional scaling respectively, to derive a smaller number of index variables. Second, the total population (N=102) was segmented into the rural and urban groups and a t-test was performed to identify significant differences between these two populations. Third, the total population was segmented into four subgroups (urban male, urban female, rural male and rural female), which were compared utilizing analysis of variance to determine the impact of gender and environment on the residents' responses. Finally, a multiple linear regression analysis of the total population and the rural and urban subgroups was done to identify the subset of independent variables that are most useful for predicting resident satisfaction.
   The results indicate that there is a difference between rural and urban residents' perceptions of their housing. Rural residents are generally more satisfied with their housing than their urban counterparts. It seems that these differences in perceptions are influenced less by gender than by environment. Finally, although there is an objective difference in the quality of housing, the results suggest that subjective evaluations may have a greater impact on satisfaction than objective measures of residential quality.

AB Measurements of the turbulent wind and temperature fluctuations were carried out in the vicinity of the roof level, over an urban surface at a site where mean gradients of wind speed and temperature were also available. The measurement heights were about 23 and 28 m above ground, the local roof level being 18 m. Measurements were taken on top of a building (at z = 23 and 28 m) and over a street canyon (at z = 23 m), i.e., fully within the urban roughness sublayer.
   The scaled variances of temperature and wind velocity, as well as the non-dimensional gradients of wind speed and temperature, are presented and discussed in terms of departures from Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. Local scaling is found to be a useful concept for the description of turbulence within a roughness sublayer. Expressions for the scaled velocity variances are presented that are valid for all measurement positions; they compare well with results from other urban studies. The non-dimensional gradient of mean wind speed is found to be well represented by the semi-empirical functions for the inertial sublayer if locally scaled. At 5 m above roof level, however, the variability due to horizontal inhomogeneity becomes very large. The non-dimensional temperature gradient, on the other hand, is height dependent and not well defined over the present rough urban surface.
