TI MODELING INTRAURBAN CONFIGURATIONAL DEVELOPMENT

DT Article
AB A set of models for intraurban context applications is proposed that enables: (a) the description of urban configurations, by the use of simple spatial categories and concepts of areal differentiation; (b) the assessment of performance of urban configurations, by the application of centrality approaches that permit reliable correlations to behavioural aspects of urban spatial structure: depending on the comprehensiveness of the chosen models such an assessment could give a picture for the whole system or the performance of discrete components within the context of the system; (c) the potentiality and stability of configurational systems, from the point of view of change. The approach differs from mainstream urban systems studies in two ways: first, an intraurban scale was defined to suit localized and detailed experimentation, as usually found in urban design situations; second, the focus was shifted from the activity system to the configurational system, again to suit urban design processes. The research summarized in this paper gives insights into the scaling of urban phenomena, suggesting that complexity, identified in large-scale urban systems, is also present in local ones. and that urban development occurs in simultaneous, although self-similar, scales

AB An investigation on how to estimate the distribution of short-duration (hours or shorter) rainfalls based on available daily rainfall measurements was undertaken. On the basis of the theory of multifractal multiplicative cascades, a scale-independent mathematical model was proposed to represent the probability distribution of rainfalls at various time scales. Using rainfall records from a network of seven recording gauges in the Montreal region in Quebec (Canada), it was found that the proposed model could provide adequate estimates of the distribution of hourly rainfalls at locations where these short-duration rainfall data are not available. Further, it has been observed that one single regional model can be developed to describe the scaling nature of rainfall distributions within the whole study area.

AB A national survey was undertaken in 1990 to investigate the periodontal treatment needs in 12 and 15 to 19-year-olds residing in urban and rural areas of Antigua. Using the CPITN procedure, examination of 246 12 year-old children and 456 adolescents (15-19 years) revealed that the CPITN scores of healthy, gingival bleeding, calculus, 4 or 5 mm and greater than or equal to 6 mm periodontal pockets were distributed similarly in urban and rural areas. Calculus was the most commonly recorded score, with a prevalence of 46% in 12-year-olds and 56% in 15-19 year-olds. 4 or 5 mm pockets were found in 14% of adolescents, affecting on average less than one sextant per subject, but deep pockets were uncommon, 26% of 12-year-olds and 14% of adolescents had periodontally healthy mouths. Scaling and oral hygiene instruction were the predominant treatment needs in both age groups, but the requirement for complex periodontal care in adolescents was low - 3% only.

AB In this comparative study on color preference in Tokyo, Taipei and Tianjin, subjects were asked to choose from a color chart the three colors they liked most and the three they liked least, in addition to stating the reasons for their choices.  The statistically significant differences obtained for both hues and tones and the results of analysis by Dual Scaling indicated that each area has unique color preference tendencies.  However, a high preference for white was common to all three areas, along with preferences for some other colors.  These results, together with those of the author's previous comparative study in Japan and Korea, thus demonstrate a common strong preference for white in four neighboring Asian areas.  The reasons given for the choices suggested that associative images of colors based on environmental and cultural aspects may be one of the important factors that influence color preference.
