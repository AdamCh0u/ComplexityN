TI COMPARISON OF AMBULANCE DISPATCH PROTOCOLS FOR NONTRAUMATIC
   ABDOMINAL-PAIN
SO ANNALS OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
LA English
DT Article
AB Study objective: To compare rates of undertriage and overtriage of six ambulance dispatch protocols for the presenting complaint of nontraumatic abdominal pain, and to identify the optimal protocol.
   Design: Retrospective prehospital and emergency department chart review to classify patients' conditions as ''emergency'' or ''nonemergency.'' Utility analysis was used to identify the preferred protocol and monetary cost-effectiveness analysis to identify the least expensive protocol.
   Setting: County emergency medical services (EMS) system with five receiving hospitals serving a mainly urban population of approximately 350,000.
   Participants: Records of 902 patients who called 911 for nontraumatic abdominal pain were reviewed; patients not transported were excluded. Twenty-seven county EMS medical directors completed questionnaires.
   Results: Six ambulance dispatch protocols for nontraumatic abdominal pain were developed: indiscriminate-dispatch, four selective protocols, and no-dispatch. A dichotomous classification system was derived prospectively from the prehospital and medical records of patients who had activated the EMS system before the study period to define ''emergency'' and ''nonemergency'' conditions associated with nontraumatic abdominal pain. Emergency criteria identified patients with conditions requiring medical treatment within 1 hour. Reviewers determined, for each patient, whether an ambulance would have been dispatched by each of the protocols. Undertriage and overtriage rates were calculated for each protocol. County EMS medical directors assigned utility Values to four potential outcomes of ambulance dispatch by the direct scaling method. The outcomes comprised correct and incorrect decisions to dispatch ambulances to patients with and without emergencies. The protocols were compared by decision analysis. A cost analysis was also performed, using an estimated marginal cost per transport of $302. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the effect of varying the cost of an undertriage error and the cost per response. Of the 788 patients included in the study, 7.8% had conditions defined as emergencies. The four selective ambulance dispatch protocols had overtriage rates ranging from 10% to 51% and undertriage rates of 4% to 7%. None of the protocols was proven superior on the basis of the medical directors' assignment of utility values. The marginal cost of dispatching advanced life support ambulances to all patients with this complaint was $3,838 per emergency.
   Conclusion: The majority of patients with nontraumatic abdominal pain who requested ambulance transport during the study period did not have conditions that were classified as emergencies. In the study model, if an undertriage error costs more than $3,674, indiscriminate ambulance dispatch is the least expensive protocol, and if an undertriage error costs less than $3,674, no ambulance dispatch is the least expensive strategy.

TI THE IMPACT OF A DEDICATED TRAUMA PROGRAM ON OUTCOME IN SEVERELY INJURED

AB Background: In recent years, many trauma centers have been closing or scaling down their operations because of financial losses and lack of commitment by the relevant authorities.
   Objective: To investigate the effect of commitment to trauma and the establishment of a dedicated trauma program on injury outcome.
   Design: In 1992, a well-funded dedicated trauma program was implemented at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center, Los Angeles. We analyzed the outcome in severely injured patients (Injury Severity Score [ISS] >15) before and after implementation of the program (1991 and 1993).
   Setting: Large, urban, level 1 trauma center.
   Patients: Patients with trauma and an ISS higher than 15.
   Results: There were 737 patients with an ISS higher than 15 in 1991 and 812 patients with an ISS higher than 15 in 1993. The overall mortality rate was 30% in 1991 and 24.5% in 1993 (P=.018), which is a reduction by 18.3%. In patients with blunt trauma and an ISS higher than 15, mortality was reduced by 33% (mortality rate of 31.1% in 1991 vs 20.8% in 1993) (P<.002). Mortality in patients with penetrating trauma and an ISS higher than 30 was reduced by 42.7% (mortality rate of 59.3% in 1991 vs 34% in 1993) (P=.019). There was also a trend toward lower permanent disabilities among survivors with an ISS higher than 15 (14.7% in 1991 vs 11.3% in 1993).
   Conclusion: Commitment of financial and human resources for the establishment of a dedicated trauma program is a sound investment in terms of improved survival and fewer permanent disabilities in critically injured patients.

TI A SURVEY OF THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF TRADITIONAL ALCOHOLIC
   BEVERAGES IN UGANDA

AB The traditional alcoholic beverages most widely consumed in Uganda include tonto from banana, ajon from finger millet (Eleusine coracana), omuramba from sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), kweete from maize and millet and waragi from molasses. As in many parts of Africa, these beverages are still produced at subsistence level Their production is cheap and labour-intensive. The brews are a result of mixed-culture fermentation and the process of fermentation continues up to tire point of consumption. The brewing techniques are passed down as a trade from older to younger generations of the family. However, with the increasing trend of rural-urban migration, and the adoption of Western culture by the younger generation, most of these fermentation techniques will die out at a time when many other countries in Asia, Latin America, west and south Africa are expanding and scaling up the processing of their respective indigenous fermented foods and beverages. Literature on Ugandan local beverages is limited. There is, therefore, a strong need to decrement the methods by which these Ugandan alcoholic beverages are produced and devise scientific means to improve their quality and optimise their production methods.
