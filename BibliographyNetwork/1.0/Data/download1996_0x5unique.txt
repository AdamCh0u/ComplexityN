AB The paper explores the contested re-configuration of the position of the national state as a result of the reworking of the scales of governance, It is argued that the intricate relationship between recent changes in the 'scaling' of the national state and the formation of new and differently 'scaled' institutional forms takes place in and through processes of urban/regional restructuring as part of an effort to 'produce' globally competitive spaces, The rise of 'glocal' forms of governance is paralleled by the formation of new elite coalitions on the one hand and the systematic exclusion or further disempowerment of politically and/or economically already weaker social groups on the other, Such exclusive homogenisation of regional spaces erodes diversity and difference in highly oppressive ways. The glocal 'entrepreneurial' or 'Schumpeterian workfare' state becomes an 'authoritarian' state, This new 'post-Fordist (?)' form of governance is unstable and re-enforces fragmentation and tension in civil society, This, in turn, not only jeopardises the potential success of the restructuring drive, but undermines social cohesion in an already fractured and fragmented regional social fabric, This thesis will be explored and documented through the analysis of the political economy of urban-regional socio-economic restructuring that paralleled the recent closure of Belgium's five remaining coal pits in the north-eastern Province of Limburg.

AB This paper describes the application of fractal dimensioning and self-similar geometric patterning properties to the strategic harvest of solar energy. Specifically, the paper examines application of fractal principles at the scales of community, building, component, and material surface. Using fundamental geometric properties as the ''simple rules applied repeatedly'', one can maximize (at differing scales) the opportunity for differentiating and managing the energy harvest to fit user(s) need. The paper discusses the use of fractal patterning as a means of dimensioning and scaling the ''ratios of transparency'' - the formal geometric expressions of conversion potential resulting from surface roughness condition(s). Roughness in fractal terms is a relative factor ranging in application from community-scale constructs on the land (which can mimic natural physiography) to the microscopic geometry of PV semi-conductor surfaces. Specific illustration at the scales cited can be correlated to the spreadsheet inventorying of energy harvest potentials. Fractal patterning provides an opportunity for treating strategies of energy harvest - embodied in community, building, component, and material surface - as seeds for a new urban form.

ID DENSITY-FUNCTIONS; URBAN; FORM
AB In this paper, we argue that the geometry of urban residential development is fractal. Both the degree to which space is filled and the rate at which it is filled follow scaling laws which imply invariance of function, and self-similarity of urban form across scale. These characteristics are captured in population density functions based on inverse power laws whose parameters are fractal dimensions. First we outline the relevant elements of the theory in terms of scaling relations and then we introduce two methods for estimating fractal dimension based on varying the size of cities and the scale at which their form is detected. Exact and statistical estimation techniques are applied to each method respectively generating dimensions which measure the extent and the rate of space filling. These methods are then applied to residential development patterns in six industrial cities in the northeastern United States, with an innovative data source from the TIGER/Line files. The results support the theory of the fractal city outlined in books by Batty and Longley and Frankhauser, but with the clear conclusion that different scale and estimation techniques generate different types of fractal dimension.

ID DAMAGE
AB Recent reports have highlighted the potential damage caused to a range of media, including materials, by ozone (O-3) The limited data available indicate significant damage to rubber products and surface coatings but either insignificant or unquantifiable damage to textiles and other polymeric materials at the range of atmospheric concentrations encountered in the U.K. Materials in the indoor environment have been excluded from economic analyses. Legislation was put in place in 1993 in the U.K. in order to reduce NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) and VOC (volatile organic compounds) emissions from motor vehicles which is likely to result in reduced peak O-3 episodes but increased average levels of O-3 in urban areas which may result in increased damage to materials. A detailed assessment of the costs of O-3 damage to materials is not currently possible because of insufficient information on relevant dose-response functions and the stock at risk. Alternative methods were thus adopted to determine the potential scale of the problem. Scaling of U.S. estimates made in the late 1960s provides a range for the U.K. of pound 170 million-pound 345 million yr(-1) in current terms. This includes damage to surface coatings and elastomers, and the cost of antiozonant protection applied to rubber goods. Independent estimates were made of the costs of protecting rubber goods in the U.K. These were based on the size of the antiozonant market, and provide cost ranges of pound 25 million-pound 63 million yr(-1) to manufacturers and pound 25 million-pound 189 million yr(-1) to consumers. The only rubber goods for which a damage estimate (not including protection costs) could be made were tyres, using data from the U.S.A. and information on annual tyre sales in the U.K. A range of pound 0-pound 4 million yr(-1) was estimated. The cost of damage to other rubber goods could not be quantified because of a lack of data on both the stock at risk and exposure-response functions. The effect of O-3 On the costs of repainting were estimated under scenarios of increased urban concentrations of O-3 using damage functions derived from the literature. The cost was estimated to be in the range of pound 0-pound 60 million yr(-1) for a change from 15 to 20 ppb O-3, and pound 0 to pound 182 million yr(-1) for a change from 15 to 30 ppb O-3. The wide ranges derived for effects on surface coatings are a reflection of the uncertainty associated with the dose-response functions used.

ID BOX-COX TRANSFORMATION
AB This paper considers the analysis of linear models where the response variable is a linear function of observable component variables. For example, scores on two or more psychometric measures (the component variables) might be weighted and summed to construct a single response variable in a psychological study. A linear model is then fit to the response variable. The question addressed in this paper is how to optimally transform the component variables so that the response is approximately normally distributed. The transformed component variables, themselves, need not be jointly normal. Two cases are considered; in both cases, the Bos-Cos power family of transformations is employed. In Case I, the coefficients of the linear transformation are known constants. In Case II, the linear function is the first principal component based on the matrix of correlations among the transformed component variables. For each case, an algorithm is described for finding the transformation powers that minimize a generalized Anderson-Darling statistic. The proposed transformation procedure is compared to likelihood-based methods by means of simulation. The proposed method rarely performed worse than likelihood-based methods and for many data sets performed substantially better. As an illustration, the algorithm is applied to a problem from rural sociology and social psychology; namely scaling family residences along an urban-rural dimension.
