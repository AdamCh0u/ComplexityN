AB Introduction: The ADL Staircase is a hierarchical instrument for the assessment of dependence/independence in personal and instrumental activities of daily living (P-ADL and I-ADL). Previous results indicated that environmental factors might affect assessment results, and revisions for use in rural areas have been tested with a gerontological population sample.
   Objective: To investigate further the cumulative structure of I-ADL in osteoporosis patients in a Swedish rural district.
   Method: Patients were interviewed consecutively concerning their pre-injury dependence in P-ADL and I-ADL, using a revised version of the ADL Staircase (n = 276).
   Results: In contrast to results from urban areas, 'transportation' was the activity generating the most dependence among the respondents. In addition, different gender-specific cumulative orders among I-ADL were demonstrated. Guttman's scaling analysis confirmed the cumulativity of the revised scale (C of R = 0.94/0.97, C of S = 0.77/0.88).
   Conclusion: Environmental factors influence the validity of instruments as well as the prevalence of disability.

AB This paper describes scale modeling of very large scale fires as a practically useful means to investigate thoroughly their mechanisms in laboratory. A good example of very large scale fires is "fire whirls". If they are generated in urban and wildland fires, they can be dangerous for the fire fighters nearby the fire whirls and will cause extensive damage in environments. For over 20 years we have collected information and conducted experimental studies of fire whirls in mass fires using scale models. These studies indicated that a large mass fire often broke out when a large earthquake hit a city of dense population. The mass fire-related casualties and destruction were far more serious than those caused by destruction of buildings and houses by the earthquake itself. A good example is the 1938 Tokyo earthquake which caused mass fires and fire whirls claiming 38,000 deaths.

AB This paper concerns the role and nature of physical modelling as applied to dispersion studies. The arguments leading to the choice of model scale are discussed. The simulation of atmospheric flows and emissions are described, in particular the similarity conditions Linking full scale and model conditions and their implications in terms of facility size and performance. We briefly summarise typical experimental programmes and treat the issues involved in interpreting results. Then we present three examples of laboratory studies. The first illustrates the ability to perform a simple plume rise simulation and the other two demonstrate building affected dispersion simulations. The final discussion centres on applications of physical modelling to urban air quality investigations.

AB High-fidelity; textured geometric models are a fundamental starting point for computer graphics, simulation, visualization, design, and analysis. Existing tools for acquiring SD models of large-scale (e.g., urban) geometry from imagery require significant manual input and suffer other algorithmic scaling limitations. We are pursuing a research and engineering effort to develop a novel sensor and associated geometric algorithms, to achieve fully automated reconstruction from close-range color images of textured geometric models representing built urban structures.
   The sensor is a geo-located camera, which annotates each acquired digital image with metadata recording the date and rime of image acquisition, and estimating the position and orientation of the acquiring camera in a global (geodetic) coordinate system. This metadata enables the formulation of reconstruction algorithms which scale well both with the number and spatial density of input images, and the complexity, of the reconstructed model.
   We describe our initial dataset of about four thousand gee-located images acquired through a prototype sensor manual surveying, and semi-automated refinement of navigation information. We demonstrate, for a small office park on the MIT campus, the operation of fully automated algorithms for generating hemispherical image mosaics, for reconstructing vertical building facades, and for estimating high-resolution texture information for each facade. Finally, we describe the status of our efforts, and discuss several significant research and engineering challenges facing the project.

AB The present study proposes a method for estimating the distribution of short-duration (e.g., 1 hour) extreme rainfalls at sites where data for the time interval of interest do not exist, but rainfall data for longer-duration (e.g., 1 day) are available (partially-gaged sites). The proposed method is based on the recently developed "scale-invariance" (or "scaling") theory. In this study, the scaling concept implies that statistical properties of the extreme rainfall processes for different temporal scales are related to each other by a scale-changing operator involving only the scale ratio. Further, it is assumed that these hydrologic series possess a simple scaling behaviour. The suggested methodology has been applied to extreme rainfall data from a network of 14 recording raingages in Quebec (Canada). The Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution was used to estimate the rainfall quantiles. Results of the numerical application have indicated that for partially-gaged sites the proposed scaling method is able to provide extreme rainfall estimates which are comparable with those based on available at-site rainfall data (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
