AB We study a few dynamical systems composed of many components whose sizes evolve according to multiplicative stochastic rules. We compare them with respect to the emergence of power laws in the size distribution of their components. We show that the details specifying and enforcing the smallest size of the components are crucial as well as the rules for creating new components. In particular, a growing system with a fixed number of components and a fixed smallest component size does not converge to a power law. We present a new model with variable number of components that converges to a power law for a very wide range of parameters. In a very large subset of this range, one obtains for the exponent a the special value I specific for the city populations distribution. We discuss the conditions in which a can take different values. In the case of the stock market, the distribution of the investors' wealth is related to the ratio between the new capital invested in stock and the rate of increase of the stook index.

AB Vehicle-induced turbulence can be an important factor of pollutant dispersion in urban areas, especially under conditions of low wind speeds which are typical for street canyons. An experimental concept (Plate, 1982) for modelling the effects of vehicle-induced turbulence was applied in the present study. The movement of vehicles was simulated in a boundary-layer wind-tunnel by small metal plates mounted on two belts moving along a modelled street canyon. The scaling factor was based on the ratio of turbulence production by cars to that by wind flow. The traffic was represented by the velocity, density, frontal area and drag coefficients of the vehicles. The velocity and traffic density were varied, and the influence of the vehicle-induced turbulence on concentration patterns at the canyon walls was studied. It was found that concentration decreases with an increasing ratio of vehicle to wind-velocity and with an increase of traffic density. A dimensionless combination of vehicle to wind-velocity ratio and density factor was proved to be a universal parameter describing the dependence of the concentration on vehicle-induced turbulence. The wind-tunnel measurements were compared with predictions by the numerical Operational Street Pollution Model (OSPM; Hertel and Berkowicz, 1989a). Differences between the wind-tunnel and numerical results regarding effects of vehicle-induced turbulence are discussed. The comparison revealed general agreement between wind-tunnel and numerical data. Turbulence and concentration measurements in a street canyon in Copenhagen have been additionally employed for analysis of the model results.

AB Unlike the case with airport terminals or the central business district, the quality of suburban pedestrian facilities is most likely affected less by congestion and more by safety, the walking environment, and aesthetics. Because the Highway Capacity Manual does not explicitly capture such factors when measuring pedestrian level of service (LOS), researchers have proposed innovative rating scales that do. These scales use either measurable characteristics, such as walkway width, median openings, and signalization parameters, or user perceptions, such as continuity and convenience, to rate a pedestrian facility. Unfortunately, the results of these scales are not always easy to interpret. For example, in a scaling system for pedestrian facilities in which a raised curb median counts 6 points and a blinking pedestrian-crossing signal counts 3 points, the developers of the scale believed that the median would be twice as valuable to pedestrians as the crossing signal. But would pedestrians agree? A scaling system was developed for pedestrian LOS and calibrated using visualization (computer-aided modeling techniques consisting of still shots and animations). Subjects' perceived ratings of a pedestrian facility after they viewed still pictures and animations of the facility were compared with the computed rating of the facility from an LOS scale. The chief value of this method is that it helps ensure that pedestrian crossing needs are systematically considered and that engineers, planners, and the public agree on the calibration of a pedestrian LOS scale. The methodology is also applicable in urban areas where pedestrian needs beyond physical capacity are to be explicitly considered. The approach is original in that visualization as a simulation and data analysis tool was used to calibrate a pedestrian LOS scale.

AB Chemical heterogeneity in a lake may arise from spatially and temporally nonuniform inputs or from spatially nonuniform transformation rates within the water body. The potential for heterogeneity to persist at a given spatial scale then depends on the relative magnitudes of the hydraulic residence time, the timescale for mixing, and the timescale for transformations to and from the chemical species of interest. Through simple scaling arguments, the potential for heterogeneity in total arsenic (As) and arsenic speciation were predicted for Upper Mystic Lake, a small urban lake near Boston, Massachusetts. Specifically, heterogeneity in total arsenic was expected during periods of high inflow-which are typical of spring conditions-given a sufficient magnitude of inflow variation. Heterogeneity in As(III) was expected throughout the year, whenever spatial variations in the net As(V)-to-As(III) transformation rate exceeded a few percent per day. Observed heterogeneity was consistent with these predictions. Although modest, heterogeneity in total As was highest in early spring (7%, expressed as the spatial standard deviation divided by the lakewide mean). By contrast, heterogeneity of As(III) was as high as 36%, indicating that spatial variation in oxidation and reduction rates is sufficient to contribute to heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in As(III) varied significantly from month to month.

AB Each phase in the long history of the world economy raises specific questions about the particular conditions that make it possible. One of the key properties of the current phase is the ascendance of information technologies and the associated increase in the mobility and liquidity of capital. There have long been cross-border economic processs-flows of capital, labor, goods, raw materials, tourists. But to a large extent these took place within the inter-state system, where the key articulators were national states. The international economic system was ensconced largely in this inter-state system. This has changed rather dramatically over the last decade as a result of privatisation, deregulation, the opening up of national economies to foreign firms, and the growing participation of national economic actors in global markets.
   It is in this context that we see a re-scaling of what are the strategic territories that articulate the new system. With the partial unbundling or at least weakening of the national as a spatial unit due to privatisationa and deregulation and its associated streghtening of globalization, come conditions for the ascendance of other spatial units or scales. Among these are the sub-national, notably cities and regions; cross-border regions encompassing two or more sub-national entities; and supra-national entities, i.e. global digitalized markets and free trade blocs. The dynamics and processes that get terrritorialized at these diverse scales can in principle be regional, national or global.
   I locate the emergence of global cities in this context and against this range of instantiations of strategic scales and spatial units (Sassen 2000a;b;c). In the case of global cities, the dynamics and processes that get territorialized are global.
   In this paper I examine first the notion that the transformations brought about by globalization and digitalization require a new conceptual architecture for their examination and interpretation. The global city is one such architecture. Section two is a more in-depth discussion of the organizing hypotheses of the global city model. Sections three and four discuss two specific features: the question of place in a global and digitalized economy and the question of the mix of sited concentrations of resources and globally spanning networks that charaterizes the global financial industry today-the most globalized, digitalized and dematerialized of ail industries.
