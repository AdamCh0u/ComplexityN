AB Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have been used to alleviate congestion problems arising due to demand during peak periods. The success of ITS strategies relies heavily on two factors: 1) the ability to accurately estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of travel demand on the transportation network during peak periods, and, 2) providing real-time route guidance to users. This paper addresses the first factor. A model to estimate time dependent origin-destination (O-D) trip tables in urban areas during peak periods is proposed. The daily peak travel period is divided into several time slices to facilitate simulation and modeling. In urban areas, a majority of the trips during peak periods are work trips. For illustration purposes, only peak period work trips are considered in this paper. The proposed methodology is based on the arrival pattern of trips at a traffic analysis zone (TAZ) and the distribution of their travel times. The travel time matrix for the peak period, the O-D trip table for the peak period, and the number of trips expected to arrive at each TAZ at different work start times are inputs to the model. The model outputs are O-D trip tables for each time slice in the peak period. 1995 data for the Las Vegas metropolitan area are considered for testing and validating the model, and its application. The model is reasonably robust, but some lack of precision was observed. This is due to two possible reasons: 1) rounding-off, and, 2) low ratio of total number of trips to total number of O-D pair combinations. Hence, an attempt is made to study the effect of increasing this ratio on error estimates. The ratio is increased by multiplying each O-D pair trip element with a scaling factor. Better estimates were obtained. Computational issues involved with the simulation and modeling process are discussed.

AB The coastal prairie ecoregion is located along the northwestern coastal plain of the Gulf of Mexico in North America. Because of agricultural and urban development, less than 1% of the original 3.4 million ha of this ecosystem type remains in native condition, making it one of the most endangered ecosystems in North America. The objective of this study was to characterize the vegetation and environmental relationships in a relatively pristine example of lowland coastal prairie in order to provide information for use in conservation and restoration. The study area was a small, isolated prairie located near the southern boundary of the coastal prairie region. Samples were taken along three parallel transects that spanned the prairie. Parameters measured included species composition, elevation, soil characteristics, indications of recent disturbance, above-ground biomass, and light penetration through the plant canopy. Fifty-four species were found in the 107 0.25-m(2) plots and a total of 96 species were found at the site. Only two non-native species occurred in sample plots, both of which were uncommon. Cluster analysis was used to identify six vegetation groups, which were primarily dominated by members of the Poaceae or Asteraceae. A conspicuous, natural edaphic feature of the prairie was the presence of 'mima' mounds, which are raised areas approximately 0.5 to 1 m high and 5 to 10 m across. Indicator species analysis revealed a significant number of species that were largely restricted to mounds and these were predominately upland and colonizing species. Ordination was performed using nonmetric, multidimensional scaling. The dominant environmental influence on species composition was found to be elevation and a host of correlated factors including those associated with soil organic content. A secondary group of factors, consisting primarily of soil cations, was found to explain additional variance among plots. Overall, this prairie was found to contain plant associations that are now rare in the surrounding landscape. Within the prairie, plant groups were largely separated by a suite of environmental conditions associated with topography. These results suggest that conservation and restoration efforts will need to carefully consider local topographic influences in order to be successful.

AB This paper describes the experiences in Ahmedabad of urban partnerships recently formed by the municipal corporation, the private sector (especially one of the most sucrssful textiles groups), local NGOs and community organizations. The Slum Networking Project is the most interesting of these experiences. The paper describes the organization,financing and implementation of this project's pilot phase and its later extension to other areas. It also discusses the difficulties faced in developing the Slum Networking Project and the institutional challenges to successfully scaling if tip. The scope of the municipal corporation's work was supported by a major improvement in the generation and management of its finances and by the national reforms (under the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act 1992) which sought to strengthen democratic government at city level.

AB The main objective of the actual investigation consist on the comparison of structure factors of two scales, which have been established to judge the opinions of the public about the bus as the most important means of urban transport. For this, a representative sample of the urban population of the Galician Autonomous Community was used. The psychometric analysis allows us to get to the conclusion that both scales have a similar scaling factor with acceptable psychometric characteristics. Moreover, then is a coincidence of opinion exposed by the regular and potential bus users, discovering that the latter used these stereotypes when formulating an opinion about the bus.

AB In this paper, we present a method that improves the standard genetic algorithms with bipolar compressed functional fitness scaling and reproduce operator based on crowding model. The improved genetic algorithm becomes a simple global search algorithm with fast convergence speed. We use it to optimize the structure and parameters of back-propagation (BP) network, which overcome the disadvantage that is easy to relapse into local minimum points and convergence speed is slow and the number of neurons in the hidden layer is determined empirically. By using the trained genetic BP network, we put forward a model that assesses the environmental impact of urban traffic. The experiment results show that the model is feasible.
