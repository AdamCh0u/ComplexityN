AB Aerosol chemical composition data for PM2.5 samples collected during the period from 1988 to 1995 at Underhill, VT, were analyzed. Sulfur and black carbon mass concentrations ranged from 0.01 to 6.5 mug m(-3) and from 0.05 to 2.2 mug m(-3), respectively, while the total fine aerosol mass concentration ranged from 0.2 to 51.1 mug m(-3). Seasonal variations with maxima during the summer and minima in winter/spring were observed for sulfur and the fine mass concentrations. No annual pattern was observed for black carbon. Seasonal variations for most of the other anthropogenic species had maxima in winter and spring and minima in the summer. A factor analysis method, positive matrix factorization (PMF), utilizing error estimates of the data to provide optimum data point scaling was used to obtain information about possible sources of the aerosol. An 11-factor solution was obtained. The six sources representing wood burning, coal and oil combustion, coal combustion emissions plus photochemical sulfate production, metal production plus municipal waste incineration, and emissions from motor vehicles were identified. Emissions from smelting of nonferrous metal ores, arsenic smelting, and soil particles and particles with high concentrations of Na were also identified by PMF. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis combines the aerosol data with the air parcel backward trajectories. PSCF was applied to identify possible source areas and pathways that give rise to the observed high particulate mass concentrations from these 11 sources. The CAPITA Monte Carlo trajectory model was used to obtain 10 sets of 5-day air parcel back trajectories arriving every 2 h for the 7-yr period from 1988 to 1995. The PSCF plot for the black carbon factor shows high probabilities in the area surrounding the sampling site, indicating a strong local influence from residential wood combustion in northern New England and southwestern Quebec. Similar large potential source areas in the midwestern United States were identified for the two coal combustion factors. The midwestern United States was also identified as the source region for the Zn-Pb factor. The oil combustion factor was associated with the east coast of the United States. The results for the Pb-Mn factor suggests high probability over the nearby Montreal urban area and the areas in the midwestern United States. The windblown dust emissions from the areas to the north are significant contributors for the soil factor. Canadian Ni smelters are the main sources for the As factor, although there is some contribution from coal-fired power plants to the south and west of Underhill, VT. It is concluded that the combination of the two receptor modeling methods, PMF and PSCF, provides an effective way. In identifying atmospheric aerosol sources and their likely locations. Emissions from different anthropogenic activities as well as secondary aerosol production are the main sources of aerosol measured in Vermont. Fuel combustion, local wood smoke, municipal waste incineration, and the secondary sulfate production collectively accounted for about 87% of the fine mass concentrations measured in Vermont.

AB A new mapping of the world derived from connections between cities is presented as a complement to the traditional world map of countries. Under conditions of contemporary globalization world cities have emerged as global service centres. These have been created by the location strategies of leading corporate service firms (e.g. in accountancy) in setting up their global office networks. Data on the offices of 46 global service firms in 55 world cities are used to define service connections between cities. Connections are converted into measures of network proximity and a multidimensional scaling is applied to these 'distances' to create a 'global service space' of cities. This new mapping of the world shows a distinctive centric structure with the major world cities (e.g. London) at the core. Investigation of this general structure reveals more subtle patterns of interacting regional and hierarchical tendencies.

AB The existing CAAD programs and design applications are not much usefull for designers with urbanistic design activities. Those applications can be utilized in design tasks, but they are not useful means to support the whole design process. To assist the urban designers in their design process, we need new CAD applications capable of providing comprehensive information to the users and supporting the urbanistic design process. To fulfil these requirments we have been working to develop an Urban-CAD program to overcome the limitations of the already existing CAD applications furthermore suit the urbanistic designers needs.

AB Differences in levels of utilization vary and are a function of socio-economic and geographical factors. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire study involving twelve GP practices in Northamptonshire, UK, of factors which affect access and utilization in asthmatics and diabetics; these groups were selected to control for differences in utilization behaviour, as a result of different aetiologies. The questionnaire sought data on: residential location of patients, utilization characteristics of primary health-care, personal circumstances and mobility and hindrances to access and utilization. Key themes were identified relating to age, gender, social class, employment, ethnicity and proximity to the GP surgery. The young, elderly and females report higher rates of utilization, as do nonmanual workers and those who are unemployed. However, accessibility and utilization vary greatly in response to mobility and locational characteristics; these variations tend to be masked by data on overall rates of usage. Optimal scaling techniques were used to investigate the interactions between the factors affecting accessibility and utilization, and to characterize patients in terms of their levels of utilization. Results confirmed that current service provision afforded a differential level of service to patients, which does not directly reflect their level of need.

TI Modes of housing provision in developing countries
SO PROGRESS IN PLANNING

DT Review

AB In the face of an estimated one billion people living in inadequate housing conditions in developing countries the need for scaling up housing supply has become an urgent focus of policy debate. To this end the expansion of the role of the private markets has formed the central thesis of the 'enabling strategy' for developing the housing sector as a whole rather than relying on project based approaches such as sites and services and settlement upgrading programmes. Policy recommendations emanating from such a standpoint concentrate on adjustments to supply and demand through deregulation and institutional development of the land and housing markets in developing countries in order to overcome largely external constraints to a more efficient market mechanism. This conception of the enabling strategy, however, has been subject to much debate and criticism for its over-concentration on the private markets and exclusion of alternative/complementary modes of housing provision from serious policy consideration. By utilising the structure and agency approach as its basic methodological tool of analysis this paper provides a comprehensive review of the scope and potential of different modes of housing provision in different contexts in developing countries. Thereby providing a firm comparative basis for examining the potential for expanded private market activity.
   The paper concludes that the severe underdevelopment of institutional capacities and human and material resources coupled with intricate and complex social, political, cultural and economic interactions between various agents and structures of provision create major obstacles to the efficiency of private land markets in developing countries. Therefore, while private markets can and should be supported they can not form the focus of the enabling strategy in most developing countries. Instead, the paper argues for a comprehensive approach to enabling strategies which combines adjustments to overall supply and demand conditions with the identification and inclusion of different modes and agents of housing provision in a holistic integrated policy.
