AB Urban slum areas are rapidly expanding throughout the developing world. Many cities are increasing their efforts on upgrading of these areas with strong encouragement and support from developing agencies. Upgrading in the first instance entails the provision of vital water supply, sanitation services, drainage and roads, coupled with a form of secure tenure. Increasingly, programmes include creation of job opportunities and widespread social services. Successes are noted at the project scale, but meeting the scale of the demand has been elusive. Scaling up efforts in order to have an appreciable impact on the ever-growing problem has become the watchword among development agencies. The Cities Alliance a global programme initiated by the World Bank and UN-Habitat-has made upgrading one of its main target areas. The World Bank itself has upgrading investments as a central thrust of the new urban strategy. Other development agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and many cities also focus increased resources on upgrading. Many conceptualise that information technology (IT) may offer a too[ to radically change the face of development. Perhaps upgrading might also benefit from IT, which could provide the impetus for rethinking and restructuring large-scale programmes. How this may be done and what this would entail is currently being explored and new approaches and best practices are gradually emerging. This paper gathers issues that came out of an international conference on large-scale upgrading as a starting point for thinking about ITuse. A map explores the various combinations of linking individuals/ communities/cities to each other and the internet, and a 'metaphorical model' is suggested as the interface at the community level. The paper concludes by considering the practical issues that IT centres would need to address for long-term viability.

AB A stochastic spatial rainfall generator is developed for use at the small spatial scale of urban and small hydrographic catchments. The generator is based on a spatial rainfall model of the conceptual and hierarchical type. It describes the spatial rainfall field in a macroscopic physic ally-based way by distinguishing rainfall entities with different scales: rain cells, cell clusters, small and large mesoscale areas (or rain storms). For applications at small spatial scales. the individual rain cells need a detailed description. Data of a dense network of rain gauges at Antwerp, enclosing 5940 rain cells in 807 rain storms are used to derive such description. For separation of the rain cells in the rainfall time series. an algorithm is developed based on the identification of increasing and decreasing rain cell flanks. The rain cells observed at different rain gauges are linked together by applying criteria for testing the similarity in rain cell properties. After separating and linking the rain cells and storms, the spatial rainfall model is calibrated to many storms by two methods (e.g. Kalman filter). The derived model structure and model parameter distributions apply to the stochastic generation of long-term time series of spatial rainfall. The model is tested by comparing intensity-duration-frequency relationships and temporal scaling properties of the generated and historical rainfall series. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB Radiance-calibrated DMSP-OLS nighttime lights data of China acquired between March 1996 and January-February 1997 were evaluated for their potential as a source of population data at the provincial, county, and city levels. The light clusters were classified into six categories of light intensity, and their area] extents were extracted from the image. Mean pixel values of light clusters corresponding to the settlements were also extracted. A light volume measure was developed to gauge the three-dimensional capacity of a settlement. A density of light cluster measure known as percent light area was also calculated for each spatial unit. Allometric growth models and linear regression models were developed to estimate the Chinese population and population densities at the three spatial levels using light area, light volume, pixel mean, and percent light area as independent variables. It was found that the DMSP-OLS nighttime data produced reasonably accurate estimates of non-agricultural (urban) population at both the county and city levels using the allometric growth model and the light area or light volume as input. Non-agricultural population density was best estimated using percent light area in a linear regression model at the county level. The total sums of the estimates for non-agricultural population and even population overall closely approximated the true values given by the Chinese statistics at all three spatial levels. It is concluded that the 1-km resolution radiance-calibrated DMSP-OLS nighttime lights image has the potential to provide population estimates of a country and shed light on its urban population from space.

AB Urban Air Pollution models require a reliable depiction of atmospheric boundary layer parameters which influence the transport, the diffusion and the chemical transformations in a domain with typical horizontal dimension of a few tenths of kilometres. This task is generally demanded to meteorological preprocessors, which provide the scaling parameters like the friction velocity u*, the Monin-Obukhov length L and the mixing height H, based on the available surface and upper air meteorological observations in the considered domain. We present a mathematical software code developed for the evaluation of turbulent fluxes and characteristic parameters governing the planetary boundary layer structure from elementary meteorological measurements. Results of the software in the characterisation of the atmospheric boundary layer over complex orography areas are presented. The accuracy of results is compared with data obtained using different approaches.

AB Sun-and shade-adapted plants of Ailanthus altissima utilized thermal-dissipative photoprotection (NPQ) across a range of photosynthetic photon flux densities (PPFD), with higher NPQ and lower maximum quantum yield of photosystem 2 photochemistry (F-v/F-m) in sun-adapted individuals, suggesting increased engagement of antennae-based quenching. Photosynthetic quantum requirements (Q(req); number of photons per CO2) were similar in sun and shade plants, but were low and comparable to forest understory species. Diurnal measurements showed that PPFDs in both habitats were consistently above photosynthetic compensation irradiance, and frequently exceeded saturating values. In addition, sun-and shade-adapted individuals possessed stomata that tracked short-term fluctuations in PPFD. Thus A. altissima may be unique in that it couples high, shade-plant like photosynthetic efficiency with high photosynthetic capacity in high-irradiance, while stomatal attributes that optimize water use efficiency are maintained in the shade. These features may contribute to success of A. altissima in establishing in disturbance-prone urban systems, and facilitate its spread into more PPFD-limited and competitive natural ecosystems.
