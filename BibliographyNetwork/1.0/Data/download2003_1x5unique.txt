AB Currently, in Ontario, Canada, around 21.7% of the total hazardous waste (HZW) collected by municipalities is waste paint. Waste latex paint (WLP) alone constitutes 12% of the total HZW. It is estimated that only 10-30% of this waste is presently being collected but this proportion is growing with public education efforts. In addition, due to increasingly more stringent environmental regulations on volatile organic compounds (VOCs), more latex-based paints will be produced compared to solvent- and oil-based alkyds. This will result in more WLP being generated annually in Ontario and across North America. The disposal cost of such waste currently varies between Can$0.90 and Can$1.40 per litre. This study was conducted in collaboration with the City of London, Ontario and the Ontario Paints and Coatings Association and aims at investigating the benefits of recycling WLP in concrete with a special focus on concrete sidewalks. WLP was used in concrete mixtures both as a partial replacement for virgin latex and for mixing water. This paper demonstrates that concrete mixtures incorporating WLP can have improved workability, higher flexural strength, lower chloride ion penetrability, better resistance to deicing salt surface scaling and can be more economic because they require less water-reducing and air-entraining admixtures. The results also indicate that the annual urban concrete sidewalk construction could use the yearly production of WLP while producing sidewalks with enhanced properties and durability.

DE compact design; CFB; 116 MWth; 220 t/h steam boiler
AB More attention is focused on since the appearance of compact CFB design. After the first pilot 75 t/h CFB boiler with water cooled square cyclone was put into operation successfully I and some shortcoming in this design was overcome, more than 80 units of this capacity boiler share the Chinese CFB market. Because of the advantage in scaling up, the 130 t/h capacity was easily developed triumphantly. Based on the success of tens of 75 t/h and 130 t/h CFB boilers with water-cooled square cyclone, the first 116MWe hot water CFB boiler, which is the biggest capacity hot water CFB boiler, began operating in the end of 2000 at Shiguang heat company, Hebei Province. It matches the rapid development of central heating system with lower emission coal fired hot water boiler for cities and communities in China. Then the first 220 t/h one was developed smoothly, which was put into operation in the end of 2001 at Weihai Cogeneration, Shandong Province. This boiler is one of the largest capacities CFB boilers with Chinese domestic technology. Its design and operating experience is also introduced in brief in this paper.

AB The proportional elections held in Brazil in 1998 and 2002 display identical statistical signatures. In particular, the distribution of votes among candidates includes a power-law regime. We suggest that the rationale behind this robust scaling invariance is a multiplicative process in which the voter's choice for a candidate is governed by a product of probabilities.

AB 1. The effects of catchment urbanisation on water quality were examined for 30 streams (stratified into 15, 50 and 100 km(2) +/- 25% catchments) in the Etowah River basin, Georgia, U.S.A. We examined relationships between land cover (implying cover and use) in these catchments (e.g. urban, forest and agriculture) and macroinvertebrate assemblage attributes using several previously published indices to summarise macroinvertebrate response. Based on a priori predictions as to mechanisms of biotic impairment under changing land cover, additional measurements were made to assess geomorphology, hydrology and chemistry in each stream.
   2. We found strong relationships between catchment land cover and stream biota. Taxon richness and other biotic indices that reflected good water quality were negatively related to urban land cover and positively related to forest land cover. Urban land cover alone explained 29-38% of the variation in some macroinvertebrate indices. Reduced water quality was detectable at c . >15% urban land cover.
   3. Urban land cover correlated with a number of geomorphic variables such as stream bed sediment size (-) and total suspended solids (+) as well as a number of water chemistry variables including nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations (+), specific conductance (+) and turbidity (+). Biotic indices were better predicted by these reach scale variables than single, catchment scale land cover variables. Multiple regression models explained 69% of variation in total taxon richness and 78% of the variation in the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) using phi variability, specific conductance and depth, and riffle phi , specific conductance and phi variability, respectively.
   4. Indirect ordination analysis was used to describe assemblage and functional group changes among sites and corroborate which environmental variables were most important in driving differences in macroinvertebrate assemblages. The first axis in a non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination was highly related to environmental variables (slope, specific conductance, phi variability; adj. R (2) =0.83) that were also important in our multiple regression models.
   5. Catchment urbanisation resulted in less diverse and more tolerant stream macroinvertebrate assemblages via increased sediment transport, reduced stream bed sediment size and increased solutes. The biotic indices that were most sensitive to environmental variation were taxon richness, EPT richness and the ICI. Our results were largely consistent over the range in basin size we tested.

AB We show that stochastic annealing can be successfully applied to gain new results on the probabilistic traveling salesman problem. The probabilistic "traveling salesman" must decide on an a priori order in which to visit n cities (randomly distributed over a unit square) before learning that some cities can be omitted. We find the optimized average length of the pruned tour follows E((L) over bar (pruned))=rootnp(0.872-0.105p)f(np), where p is the probability of a city needing to be visited, and f(np)-->1 as np-->infinity. The average length of the a priori tour (before omitting any cities) is found to follow E(L-a priori)=rootn/pbeta(p), where beta(p)=1/[1.25-0.82 ln(p)] is measured for 0.05less than or equal topless than or equal to0.6. Scaling arguments and indirect measurements suggest that beta(p) tends towards a constant for p<0.03. Our stochastic annealing algorithm is based on limited sampling of the pruned tour lengths, exploiting the sampling error to provide the analog of thermal fluctuations in simulated (thermal) annealing. The method has general application to the optimization of functions whose cost to evaluate rises with the precision required.
