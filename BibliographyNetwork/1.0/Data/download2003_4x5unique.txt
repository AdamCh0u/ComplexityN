AB Before 1979, there were only 5 undergraduate dental schools in Iran with a total admission of 200 students per year, and only 2,000 dentists and about 50 specialists practicing in the country. Currently, there are 18 dental schools with a total admission of 750 undergraduate students, 5 postgraduate programs in 10 disciplines with a total of 100 students, more than 11,000 dentists (1 dentist per 5,500 population) and nearly 1,000 specialists in the country. Two new schools have recently begun offering specialty training courses in 2 disciplines. The length of the dentistry curriculum is 6 years. Students take general and basic science courses during the first 2 years, then continue on the predental and dental courses for the remaining 4 years. The curriculum has been revised over the past 20 years to establish intership and specialty programs and introduce courses reflecting current trends in the dental profession. Dental services in Iran are provided by both public and private sectors. Oral health care was integrated into the Public Health Care network by 1997, and 4 levels of a Dental Health Care Delivery System were established. The first level is concerned with primary prevention at 'health houses', where auxiliary health workers called 'behvarzes' provide periodic examinations, referrals, and oral health education. At the next level, oral hygienists and dentists in 'health centers' perform basic oral health care services such as fillings, scaling, and extraction. At the third level, dentists manage and treat oral diseases in 'urban health centers', while the last level is for advanced treatment by specialists in university health centers in the cities.

AB There have long been cross-border economic processes. In the last hundred years, the inter-state system came to provide the dominant organizational form cross-border flows, with national states as its key actors. This condition has changed dramatically over the last decade and more, as a result of privatization, deregulation, the opening up of national economies to foreign firms and the growing participation of national economic actors in global markets. In this context, we see a re-scaling of what are the strategic territories that articulate the new system. The organizational architecture for cross-border flows that results from these re-scaling and articulations increasingly diverges from that of the inter-state system. My central effort here is to contribute to empirical and theoretical specification of this organizational architecture. Among the features examined here are the combination of centralization and dispersal trends, the disproportionate concentration of value and transactions in the North Atlantic, the role of cities in an increasingly digitized global economy, especially as illustrated by the growth of finance and specialized services, and the impact of information technologies on urban economies.

ID BLOOD CULTURE SYSTEM; 4-DAY INCUBATION; BACTEC-9240; INFECTIONS;
   BACTEREMIA
AB Surge capacity is the ability to rapidly mobilize to meet an increased demand. While large amounts of federal funding have been allocated to public health laboratories, little federal funding has been allocated to hospital microbiology laboratories. There are concerns that hospital laboratories may have inadequate surge capacities to deal with a significant bioterrorism incident. A workflow analysis of a clinical microbiology laboratory that serves an urban medical center was performed to identify barriers to surge capacity in the setting of a bioterrorism event and to identify solutions to these problems. Barriers include a national shortage of trained medical technologists, the inability of clinical laboratories to deal with a dramatic increase in the number of blood cultures, a delay while manufacturers increase production of critical products and then transport and deliver these products to clinical laboratories, and a shortage of class 11 biological safety cabinets. Federal funding could remedy staffing shortages by making the salaries of medical technologists comparable to those of similarly educated health care professionals and by providing financial incentives for students to enroll in clinical laboratory science programs. Blood culture bottles, and possibly continuous-monitoring blood culture instruments, should be added to the national antibiotic stockpile. Federal support must ensure that companies that manufacture essential laboratory supplies are capable of rapidly scaling up production. Hospitals must provide increased numbers of biological safety cabinets and amounts of space dedicated to clinical microbiology laboratories. Laboratories should undertake limited cross-training of technologists, ensure that adequate packaging supplies are available, and be able to move to a 4-day blood culture protocol.

DE hybrid energy system; fuzzy logic controller; self tuning
AB Generation of electricity for urban regions usually depends on the national electricity grid. But, the generation of the electricity in remote and rural areas which, are far from the national grid is diffuclt and very expensive. Therefore, PV-Wind-Diesel-Battery hybrid energy systems represent an attractive alternative solution. But, these systems are usually non linear in nature and have unpredicatable parameters variations with time. This paper presents a robust self-tuning PI-type fuzzy logic controller (STFPIC). Depending on the process trend, the output scaling factor (SF) of the controller is modified on-line by an updating factor (r). The value of r is determined from a rule-base defined based on error (E) and change of error (DeltaE) of the controller variable. The proposed self-tuning controller is designed using a very simple control rule-base and the most natural membership functions (MF). The proposed scheme is tested for a different numbers of membership functions with using Matlab-Simulink. Also, the comparative between FLC and the self-tuning fuzzy PI controller is cleared. The results show that our proposed scheme gives a more robust performance the normal fuzzy logic controller (FLC).

AB This paper contributes to the demonstration that the self-similar city hierarchies with cascade structure can be modeled with a pair of scaling laws reflecting the recursive process of urban systems. First we transform the Beckmann's model on city hierarchies and generalize Davis's 2(n)-rule to an r(n)-rule on the size-number relationship of cities (r > 1), and then reduce both Beckmann's and Davis's models to a pair of scaling laws taking the form of exponentials. Then we derive an exact three-parameter Zipf-type model from the scaling laws to revise the commonly used two-parameter Zipf model. By doing so, we reveal the fractal essence of central place hierarchies and link the rank-size rule to central place model logically. The new mathematical frameworks are applied to the class counts of the 1950-70 world city hierarchy presented by Davis in 1978, and several alternative approaches are illustrated to estimate the fractal dimension.
