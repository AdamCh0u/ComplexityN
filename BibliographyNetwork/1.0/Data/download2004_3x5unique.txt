AB Leishmaniasis represents a complex of diseases with an important clinical and epidemiological diversity. Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is of higher priority than cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) as it is a fatal disease in the absence of treatment. Anthroponotic VL foci are of special concern as they are at the origin of frequent and deathly epidemics (e.g. Sudan). Leishmaniasis burden remains important: 88 countries, 350 million people at risk, 500,000 new cases of VL per year, 1-1.5 million for CL and DALYs: 2.4 millions. Most of the burden is concentrated on few countries which allows clear geographic priorities. Leishmaniasis is still an important public health problem due to not only environmental risk factors such as massive migrations, urbanisation, deforestation, new irrigation schemes, but also to individual risk factors: HIV, malnutrition, genetic, etc... Leishmaniasis is part of those diseases which still requires improved control tools. Consequently WHO/TDR research for leishmaniasis has been more and more focusing on the development of new tools such as diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines. The ongoing effort has already produced significant results. The newly available control tools should allow a scaling up of control activities in priority areas. In anthroponotic foci, the feasibility of getting a strong impact on mortality, morbidity and transmission, is high. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   aural space; sonic ambience
AB HOW DO we describe city spaces? There has been, in recent years, a prolixity of differing views on the treatment of this question in which two opposing general tendencies stand out: the reductionist and the phenomenological positions. Reductionist theorists argue that a city is no more than a lattice of physical enclosures, apertures, planes, intersections bound together by the regulatory force of the Cartesian grid. A phenomenological approach, on the other hand, can provide a theory of wider scope; it can include in the description of a city's attributes the corporeal, the sensual and psychological aspects of subjective experience, as well as the broader cultural characteristics of the different communities and subcultures which contribute to the diversity of city spaces. From this point of view, the reductionist position appears locked within its own rigidity, creating ossified spaces by relying on the method of deductive analysis, rather than on direct sensory experience. Non-reductive theories (of which there are many different kinds) align themselves with the notion that a city is not just the sum total of buildings and streets; indeed, it is not generated by the neat ontological division of container and contained: metaphorical space can supervene upon the physical divisions of the urban metropolis.
   The phenomenological view adopts a body-centred paradigm in which there is no clear dichotomy between the experiencing subject and the external world. On this reading, time and space are perceived as fluid rather than immutably constituted. Space does not have an a priori character; it is defined and moulded by the subjectivity and social consciousness of those who experience and inhabit it. This has significant implications for understanding the role of sound as a component of urban experience. For the phenomenologist there is no veil of sense-data interposed between the epistemological subject and the objects of perception. Instead of space in the abstract, we may invoke the much more mercurial concept of place. Place allows particular localities to be defined in terms of their history and social use, investing them with cultural meanings and values and making them available for active intervention and transformation.
   Place can be used as a concept to define a geographical area on the scale of nation-states, or the intimate domain of the home. It can mean the reconfiguring of social boundaries. For a Jewish community, for example, the demarcation of the Eruv redefines an existing public space and creates a sanctuary as an extension of the sacred space of home or the synagogue. Ritual and custom are attributes that have the effect of strengthening attachment to places. A sense of place can also be generated through subeultural re-appropriation, such as the use of the concrete ramps and steps underneath London's South Bank centre by skateboarders. Place fuses the real with the mythical, the virtual with the actual; it is a space which encourages flights of imagination, as for instance in Robert J. Yudell's description of the Chrysler building 'Here we have not only the vertical differentiation of the building but chunky setbacks which conjure landscapes or grand stairways. We can imagine scaling, leaping and occupying its surface and interstices' (Bloomer and Moore, 1977). The essential point, I think, of this phenomenological approach, is to show that it is not the space itself that changes; rather it implies a transformation in attitude to space and how we define it.
   Our climate, culturally speaking, is increasingly defined in terms of visual space. Media and communication for the most part are equated with billboards, television and recently DVD. Aural space has, for the moment, become merely a ubiquitous presence, to be registered peripherally.
   However, I will argue that sound, especially within the context of the urban environment, is never a neutral phenomenon. Each sound is imbued with its own lexical code: sound as sign, symbol, index; as ostensibly defining a personal territory in the case of the ghettoblaster or car stereo; as creating a portable soundscape in the case of the Walkman.
   Phenomenology has the potential to play a critical role in contributing towards an aural definition of space, but its impact has yet to be fully realized. There has been, however, a group of practitioners who have sought to articulate a humanist account of the sonic environment. Essentially, soundscape design alms to increase people's awareness of their own sonic environment in order that they might play an active role in its subsequent transformation: eliminating noise which desensitizes the ear, while preserving sounds whose semantic signals play a defining role for a community or churches respect the need for quiet contemplation. Churches and cathedral spaces are particularly interesting in cities because they are among the few spaces which stretch time. Long reverberation times affect actions within the space, slowing movement and speech; small incidental sounds are magnified, allowing the listener to appreciate internal harmonic fluctuations as the tone decays. The acoustic ability to stretch sound has several different effects: speech which allows time for the words to hang in the air before evaporating out of audible range can appear more weighty and monumental, even rhetorical. Within these spaces incidental sound material, sounds which we may treat as aural dust, footfalls or the occasional cough, are also given heightened presence through filtering and natural amplification. Lengthening a sound's life has invested it with a reverential sanctity that is usually reserved for ecclesiastical objects. The church as acoustic vessel tends to give the worshipper a multi-sensory experience of the sacred. Music theorist Kurt Blaukopf has suggested that sound could be seen as a mediator between congregation and sacred ritual. Low-frequency non-directional sound helps to bind a community together:
   This directness of sounds that cannot be located contributes significantly to the social effect of the musical-liturgical event. The anonymity of the sound source built into the architecture is the acoustic guarantee for the internalizing of church norms and, at the same time, the basis for the view that comprehends church liturgy as part of the heavenly liturgy. (Blaukopf, 1982: 182)
   So, what is an urban soundscape? I have described various aspects of what constitutes an urban sonic fabric. Schafer's approach has merit insofar as it has defined terms which enable a listener to decipher the aural landscape. However, embedded in his work is a romantic bias towards antiquarian or rural soundscapes, as if these are assumed to be more refined than their modern-day equivalents. While Schafer's energy is spent defending the case for cleaning up urban pollutants, other issues, such as whether sound can aid our understanding of social relationships between communities, get left aside. These aspects are examined in the work of both Corbin and Stoekfeld, and surprisingly these reveal similar tendencies in asserting the significance of acoustic territory.
   Important for me is the notion that aural space is both tactile and ephemeral: it cannot be contained within fixed boundaries. Sound objects can be electronically magnified, replicated and scattered like dust over an entire cityscape. Aural space should be celebrated as the most liquid of spaces, offering a model for the kind of fluidity that a whole range of other disciplines aspire to.

AB The roll back malaria (RBM) movement promotes the use of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs) and intermittent presumptive treatment (IPT) of malaria infection as preventive measures against the adverse effects of malaria among pregnant women in Africa. To determine the use of these preventive measures we undertook a community-based survey of recently pregnant women randomly selected from communities in four districts of Kenya in December 2001. Of the 1814 women surveyed, only 5% had slept under an ITN. More than half of the 13% of women using a bednet (treated or untreated) had bought their nets from shops or markets. Women from rural areas used bednets less than urban women (11%vs. 27%; P < 0.001), and 41% of the bednets used by rural women had been obtained free of charge from a research project in Bondo or a nationwide UNICEF donation through antenatal clinics (ANCs). Despite 96% of ANC providers being aware of IPT with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), only 5% of women interviewed had received two or more doses of SP as a presumptive treatment. The coverage of pregnant women with at least one dose of IPT with SP was 14%, though a similar percentage also had received at least a single dose as a curative treatment. The coverage of nationally recommended strategies to prevent malaria during pregnancy during 2001 was low across the diverse malaria ecology of Kenya. Rapid expansion of access to these services is required to meet international and national targets by the year 2005. The scaling up of malaria prevention programmes through ANC services should be possible with 74% of women visiting ANCs at least twice in all four districts. Issues of commodity supply and service costs to clients will be the greatest impediments to reaching RBM targets.

AB Research involving different forms of networks, such as internet networks, social networks, and cellular networks, has increasingly become an important field of study. From this work, a variety of different scaling laws have been discovered. However, these aspatial laws, stemming from graph theory, often do not apply to spatial networks. When searching for network holes, results from graph theory frequently do not correlate with 2D spatial holes that enforce planarity. We present a general approach for finding holes in a 2D spatial network, and in particular for a network representing street centrelines of an area in Washington, D.C. This methodology involves finding graph holes that can be restricted to 2D spatial holes by examining topological relationships between network features. These spatial network holes gain significance as the number of edges encompassing the hole, and the length of these edges increase. For this reason, our approach is designed to classify these holes into different sets based on the number of edges found and the length of those edges. The results of this application provide valuable insights in the nature of the network, highlighting areas that we know from experience are poorly connected and thus suffer from low accessibility.

AB Quantifying carbon dynamics over large areas is frequently hindered by the lack of consistent, high-quality, spatially explicit land use and land cover change databases and appropriate modeling techniques. In this paper, we present a generic approach to address some of these challenges. Land cover change information in the Southeastern Plains ecoregion was derived from Landsat data acquired in 1973, 1980, 1986, 1992, and 2000 within 11 randomly located 20-km x 20-km sample blocks. Carbon dynamics within each of the sample blocks was simulated using the General Ensemble Biogeochemical Modeling System (GEMS), capable of assimilating the variances and covariance of major input variables into simulations using an ensemble approach. Results indicate that urban and forest areas have been increasing, whereas agricultural land has been decreasing since 1973. Forest clear-cutting activity has intensified, more than doubling from 1973 to 2000. The Southeastern Plains has been acting as a carbon sink since 1973, with an average rate of 0.89 Mg C/ha/yr. Biomass, soil organic carbon (SOC), and harvested materials account for 56%, 34%, and 10% of the sink, respectively. However, the sink has declined continuously during the same period owing to forest aging in the northern part of the ecoregion and increased forest clear-cutting activities in the south. The relative contributions to the sink from SOC and harvested materials have increased, implying that these components deserve more study in the future. The methods developed here can be used to quantify the impacts of human management activities on the carbon cycle at landscape to global scales.
