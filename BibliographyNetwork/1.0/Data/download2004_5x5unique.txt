AB In this paper, a new automatic control point selection and matching technique for satellite image registration is proposed. The characteristic of this approach is that it uses features based on image moments and invariant to symmetric blur, scaling, translation, and rotation to establish correspondences between matched regions from two multitemporal images. The automatic extraction of control points is based on an edge detection approach and on local similarity detection by means of template matching according to a combined invariants-based similarity measure. The final transformation of the sensed image according to the selected control points is performed by using the thin-plate spline (TPS) interpolation. The proposed technique has been successfully applied to register multitemporal SPOT images from urban and agricultural areas. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm which have outperformed manual registration in terms of root mean square error at the control points.

ID PARTNERSHIPS
AB This paper discusses the challenges to expanding successful, small-scale urban upgrading initiatives in developing countries, using empirical data from the Slum Networking Project (SNP) in Ahmedabad, India. Despite demonstrated success in providing infrastructure and community development services in 27 slum communities, the SNP has had difficulty expanding its activities beyond this small proportion of the city's 2,431 low income neighbourhoods. Our case analysis suggests that it is neither insufficient funding nor a lack of political will - both of which are regularly identified as reasons why successful upgrading programmes are not scaled up - that has impeded progress in the Ahmedabad case. Instead, a mismatch between the bundle of services offered by the Municipal Corporation and the priorities of slum households, along with the terms of the partnership between the corporation and the SNP's NGO partners, are among the principal explanations for the SNP's slow rate of expansion.

AB This paper presents an analysis of the growth of towns in the Tel Aviv metropolis. It indicates a similarity in the variation of populations so that the population functions can be scaled and superposed one onto the other. This is a strong indication that the growth mechanism for all these towns is the same. Two different models are presented to interpret the population growth: one is an analytic model while the other is a computer simulation. In the dynamic analytic model, we introduced the concept of characteristic time. The growth has two parts: in the first, the derivative is an increasing function, the town is very attractive and there is short delay between decision to build and complete realization of the process. At this time, there is no shortage of land. However, around a specific time, the delay begins to increase and there is lack of available land. The rate of the population variation decreases until saturation. The two models give a good quantitative description.

AB BACKGROUND: Because cancer is now the first and second leading causes of death in both of urban and suburban area in China, there are increasing demands for measurement tools to assess quality of life in Chinese cancer patients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties of the standard Chinese version of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30, version 3.0).
   METHODS: The questionnaire was administered before, during, and after treatment of 143 patients with breast, gynecological, or lung cancer in six hospitals in China.
   RESULTS: Cronbach's alpha coefficients for multi-item scales were greater than 0.70 before and during treatment, except for the cognitive functioning scale. Multitrait scaling analysis showed that most of the item-scale correlation coefficients met the standards of convergent and discriminant validity. All scales and items exhibited good reproducibility, criterion-related validity, and construct validity. Score changes over time were observed in the following scales: physical, role, and social functioning; global quality of life; fatigue; nausea/vomiting. Score changes were also observed in the appetite loss item.
   CONCLUSION: The standard Chinese version of the EORTC QLQ-C30 is overall a valid instrument to assess the quality of life of Chinese cancer patients.

AB "Demands and preferences in Russia's credit service market" (by Denis Strebkov) analyzes various aspects of credit behavior adapted by population under current Russian conditions. To make this popular post-soviet behavior transparent, households (close to a thousand) had been studied in five cities of Russia late in 2002. In particular, experiences of borrowing and lending money practices are scrutinized in the paper. An evaluation is offered regarding popular approach to credits. Structure of the demand for credit services is studied as the size, interest rates, and terms of repayment characterize them. Method of multi-dimensional scaling permitted to disclose basic reasons for the citizens, on the one side, to use borrowing tactics, while, on the other, to avoid obtaining the credit. In general, credit facilities are scarcely known among population, and governmentally protected services are grossly preferred.
