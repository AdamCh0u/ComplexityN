AB In Budapest many public buildings are constructed of limestone that is susceptible to soiling and decay. The two most common types used are i) Miocene oolitic limestone (coarse limestone) and ii) Pleistocene freshwater limestone (travertine). The textural differences between the two limestones are well expressed in the differences of decay phenomena. The oolitic limestones show intense crust formation and blackening. The crusts are prone to scaling and/or flaking followed by rapid substrate material loss (granular disintegration). As a consequence, significant loss in volume and decrease in strength are attributed to urban air pollution. The freshwater limestones exhibit only blackened surface crusts, but these crusts appear to be stable and they do not tend to lead to scaling. Within the urban environment, this blackening of freshwater lime stone facades is primarily an aesthetic problem. Freshwater limestone appears to more durable than the oolitic limestone. This difference in durability appears to be related to textural differences: i) larger pore size, ii) smaller effective porosity, iii) higher rate of cementation and strength. These two limestones demonstrate the effectiveness of in-situ non-destructive petrophysical tests such as Schmidt hammer and Duroscope as methods of assessing limestone durability.
