AB This study aims at adopting modeling tools focusing multi-scale problem solving in basins with irrigation water uses. Multi-scaling may help conflict solving since an approach to the scale close to that where conflicts occur is more appropriate for understanding and dealing with related problems. It mainly applies to rural basins where competition among agricultural and non-agricultural uses is high during periods when water availability is scarce. The approach refers to the field scale modeling relative to agricultural demand considering soils, crops and crop patterns, cropping techniques, environment factors, irrigation practices and restrictions to water use (ISAREG model), and basin scale water resource planning models including non-agricultural uses-urban, domestic, industrial, recreational and other uses (SAGBAH model). Analyses of scenarios require then a multi-scale approach. It results a tool that produces a distributed spatial analysis of the agricultural demand, while non-agricultural uses refer to sub-basins. Simplicity in model operation is aimed. The model operates interactively, sharing results from the sub-models, in order to obtain the information required to define strategies for crop irrigation management and to assess impacts on the non-agricultural users, and to generate rules for water allocation in the basin. The inulti-scale analyses allows to improve knowledge on the processes relative to water use, to understand spatial and temporal variations, to simulate with historical data and for different scenarios, including those that may result from climate change. Furthermore, the software system works in a serni-automatic way allowing the user to interact along all computations steps, particularly relative to the interaction among scales. Selected results are included in this paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Reverse Osmosis is finding increasing use for the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewaters due to the growing demand for high quality water in large urban areas, The growing success of membranes in this application is related to improved process designs and improved membrane products. Key factors which have been determined to result in successful operation of large-scale plants will be discussed. Factors which play a key role in the use of RO membranes include ultra or microfiltration pretreatment, low fouling membranes, flux rate, recovery and control of fouling and scaling. In particular, high flux rates can be used when UF or MF pretreatment is used. These technologies remove most of the suspended particles that would normally cause heavy fouling of lead elements. Typically, fluxes in the range of 17 - 21 lmh lead to cleaning frequencies in the range of 3 - 4 months. By combining the use of membrane pretreatment and chloramination of the feed water through chlorine addition, two of the primary sources of RO membrane fouling can be controlled. The use of chloramine has become a proven means to control biofouling in a membrane for wastewater applications. The other significant problems for RO membranes result from organics fouling by dissolved organics and scaling due to saturation of marginally soluble salts. The former can be a significant problem for membranes, due to the strong attraction forces. To some extent, these can be mitigated by making the membrane surface more hydrophilic or changing the charge of the membrane surface. To minimize fouling, many plants are turning to low fouling membranes. Extensive studies have demonstrated that the membrane surface is hydrophilic, neutrally charged over a broad pH range, and more resistant to organic adsorption. Also, an analysis of the potential scaling issues will be reviewed. In particular, calcium phosphate has been found to be one of the key scalants that will limit RO system recovery rate. Calcium phosphate concentrations can reach high values in many wastewaters, and scaling of this compound is not often modeled in most RO projection software. Various process options will be presented to evaluate the most economic means of avoiding phosphate scaling. Finally, data from major RO wastewater treatment plants will be presented to show how the RO membranes operate under actual conditions, utilizing many of these design features. Long term data from the 2.6 mgd Bedok demonstration Plant demonstrate that the RO membranes operate consistently on wastewater. Experiences from the 8.5 mgd (32,000 m(3)/day) Bedok and 10.5 mgd (40,000 m(3)/day) Kranji plants will also be presented. These large plants started operation in the fall of 2002 and have demonstrated an effective means to reclaim high quality water from difficult source waters, such as municipal wastewaters.

AB A detailed qualitative study on assessing and managing urban risks, co-financed by the European Commission (EC), is in progress. Key findings and preliminary results underline the importance of safety and security issues for urban life quality. This paper presents the findings of this study aiming at proposing a European wide strategy for Urban Risks assessment and management by taking into account legal status and current practices at EU 25. A structured questionnaire was addressed to National Authorities aiming to gain an insight into existing law provisions, emergency planning and urban risk management practices. An analysis of the replies highlighted the diversity of both urban risks and emergency management structures. The risks investigated cover a range from natural catastrophes and technological failures to terrorism and intended actions threats. Risks were ranked by priority according to frequency of occurrence and consequences. The scaling of hazards, the identification and mapping of risks, the severity of consequences and matters concerning mutual assistance in major emergencies are identified as the priority fields. A refined version of the results, following consultations with the parties involved and the EC forms the basis of the project proposals.
   The complexity of the modem urban Environment, urbanisation trends, increasing vulnerability and the different approaches in dealing with urban risks, indicate a clear need for a common platform and a unified approach across the EU. Basic components of a suggested unified approach and an EU wide mitigation strategy are also discussed.

AB This work was aimed at performing an analysis of the integrated urban wastewater system (catchment area, sewer, WWTP, receiving water). It focused on analysing the substance fluxes going through the system to identify critical pathways of pollution, as well as assessing the effectiveness of energy consumption and operational/capital costs. Two different approaches were adopted in the study to analyse urban wastewater systems of diverse characteristics. In the first approach a wide ranged analysis of a system at river basin scale is applied. The Nete river basin in Belgium, a tributary of the Schelde, was analysed through the 29 sewer catchments constituting the basin. In the second approach a more detailed methodology was developed to separately analyse two urban wastewater systems situated within the Ruhr basin (Germany) on a river stretch scale. The paper mainly focuses on the description of the method applied. Only the most important results are presented. The main outcomes of these studies are: the identification of stressors on the receiving water bodies, an extensive benchmarking of wastewater systems, and the evidence of the scale dependency of results in such studies.

AB Ecological risk assessments at military installations that are performed to support natural resources management objectives rely on information from the surrounding region. Stressors such as noise, ozone, and ozone precursors cross installation boundaries, and effects of urbanization and highway development are regional in scale. Ecological populations are not limited to one side of the installation boundary. Therefore, a framework for transboundary ecological risk assessment at military installations is under development. This article summarizes the problem formulation stage. Components include: (1) regional management goals such as installation Integrated Natural Resources Management Plans and land acquisition, (2) involvement of multiple stressors, and (3) large-scale assessment endpoint entities. Challenges of selecting measures of exposure include: quantifying exposure to aggregate stressors, describing land cover consistently in the region, describing rates of land-cover transition, scaling local measurements to a region, and aggregating or isolating exposures from within and outside of the installation. Measures of effect that are important to transboundary or regional ecological risk assessments at military installations are those that represent: effects at a distance from the stressor, large-scale effects, effects of habitat change or fragmentation, spatial extrapolations of localized effects, and integrated effects of multiple stressors. These factors are reflected in conceptual models.
