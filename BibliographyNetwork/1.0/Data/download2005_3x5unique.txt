AB Landscape patterns originate from exogenous (e.g., climate) and endogenous (e.g., competition) processes and feedbacks that interact spatially and temporally. The resulting dynamics can be analyzed and quantified using spatio-temporal models. Various approaches are currently in use, ranging from generic to process-oriented models. However, strict classifications are difficult as models can be characterized by many different criteria. One important distinction is structural complexity. This may manifest itself in: (1) conceptual complication of the modelling approach, (2) the translation of the system complexity into model formalism, and (3) the level of detail of the simulated output.
   Thus, process models that mirror systems by quantifying individual biotic and/or abiotic processes may be referred to as complex models since their simulated output usually identifies explicit system details that require many input parameters mirroring the system bottom-up. Generic models, on the other hand, tend to be structurally parsimonious, usually not accounting for specific system details. They are often applied to study topics of complex systems theory such as emergence, self-organization, scaling, and chaos theory, and involving techniques used in non-linear dynamical systems theory.
   This special issue identifies concepts and methods used by models to represent spatially dynamic landscape patterns. It assesses relationships between landscape and model complexity, and discusses approaches to quantify the spatio-temporal pattern dynamics resulting from model simulations. The models presented here address a variety of different research topics, including climate change, urban development, ecological engineering, landscape classification concepts, spatial population dynamics, habitat fragmentation, and conservation. The models account for different biotic levels (individual, population, vegetation patterns), and are driven by both exogenous and endogenous processes.
   Identification and quantification of the landscape patterns produced by the simulated output relies on various indicators. Discrete-static indicators include landscape metrics. Static pattern descriptions involve fractal dimensions, whereas dynamic indicators include power spectra, entropy, or indicators of patch aggregation.
   Thematically, this special issue contributes to a variety of key topics in landscape ecology, including consideration of anthropogenic impacts on landscapes, or holistic approaches such as self-organization, or the governing role of connectivity in shaping ecological systems.

AB The increasing diversity of immigrant-receiving countries calls for measures of residential segregation that extend beyond the conventional two-group approach. The authors represent simultaneously the relative social distance occupied by a wide array of ethnic groups. They use census tract tabulations for the Toronto Consolidated Metropolitan Area in 1996 and the technique of multidimensional scaling to summarize the residential neighborhood pattern of the city's largest 50 ethnic groups. From the two-dimensional multidimensional scaling configuration, the authors find that African/Caribbean groups and blacks were highly clustered and shared common patterns of segregation with other groups. This study highlights the value of looking beyond broad racial or panethnic classifications in understanding ethnic congregation and residential segregation patterns. The results also demonstrate the merits of this method in providing a more conceptually meaningful way to understand social distance among groups.

AB The problems of the need for water in the quantity and quality for the diverse uses that we require of it is one of the principal problems that we must address. More and more plants are installed for the production of water for potable, irrigation or industrial uses that employ membrane technologies, especially reverse osmosis. Moreover, with increasing frequency these techniques are also being employed in the recycling of waters from urban and industrial effluents.
   Paralleling the development of these techniques and their new applications is the need for advances in understanding of the processes that affect their functioning and yield. Any reverse osmosis installation will in the medium or long term encounter problems of membrane fouling that necessitate cleansing. The cleansing protocol depends on the type of deposit (biofilm, organic matter, inorganic deposits or natural colloids) present in the membranes, which makes its characterisation indispensable.
   A "membrane autopsy" combines different procedures of analysis and tests capable of revealing information relating to the nature of the deposits and other aspects that can be associated with deficiencies in the functioning of the installations. In this way we have a toolkit able to compile the data necessary for the planning of new guidelines for the management of installations that will minimise or delay the appearance of the problems detected.

ID POLLUTION; PM10
AB Several epidemiological studies have shown an association between particulate air pollution and health effects. Suspended particulates and more specifically the inhalable PM10 fraction appear to cause respiratory health effects and heart diseases. Furthermore, particulate pollution is of paramount importance in areas with open-pit mines and especially when it is combined with raw lignite transfer and combustion in power stations through the suspension of particles and stack emissions, respectively. The penetration of particles into respiratory track is a function of the size of the particles and thus, it is more likely for the finer PM2.5 fraction to reach the deepest of the lugs.
   The fast economic growth the last decades has resulted in an increase of the sources of pollution not only in large metropolitan areas but also in medium-sized urban areas like the city of Kozani, Greece. It is the most densely populated city in the area of West Macedonia affected by urban particulate matter originated from local and stationary sources, from regional and long-range transport, and from street dust resuspension. Kozani is located a few kilometers away from lignite power stations that contribute to about 70% of the total electrical energy produced in Greece. Dust emissions seem to be the most serious problem in the area, as the measured ambient concentrations of suspended particles are at high levels and exceed local and international standards.
   In this study PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations are presented. The measurements have been carried out, from April to December 2002, by the Lab of Atmospheric Pollution and Environmental Physics (LAPEP) of Technological Education Institute of West Macedonia in the commercial centre of the city of Kozani.
   The temporal variation of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations was studied and allowed a further insight on the factors affecting the measured ambient particulate levels. PM2.5 - PM10 correlation and PM2.5/PM10 ratios were investigated and compared to those in the literature together with the factors affecting their diurnal variation.
   The pollution levels were also detected in process of the experimental time series data by fractal dimension. Generally, fractal analysis is able to detect the data set complexity by scaling empirical data using threshold values. These values define the levels of air pollution episodes. The method presented in this study, is the transformation of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations into a set of points whose dimension was estimated by box counting. This technique has estimated the fractal dimension of both the time series by the relationship between data variance and time scale.

AB It is found by experiment that under the thermal convection condition, the temperature fluctuation in the urban canopy layer turbulence has the hard state character, and the temperature difference between two points has the exponential probability density function distribution. At the same time, the turbulent energy dissipation rate e fits the log-normal distribution, and is in accord with the hypothesis proposed by Kolmogorov in 1962 and lots of reported experimental results. In this paper, the scaling law of hard state temperature n order structure function is educed by the self-similar multiplicative cascade models. The theory formula is xi n = n/3-mu{n(n+6)/72+[2Inn!-nIn2]/2In6}, and mu is intermittent exponent. The formula can fit the experimental results up to order 8 exponents, is superior to the predictions by the Kolmogorov theory, the beta and log-normal model.
