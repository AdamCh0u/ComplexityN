AB One-year series of hourly average ozone observations, which were obtained from urban and national park air monitoring stations at Taipei (Taiwan), were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics and fractal methods to examine the scaling structures of ozone concentrations. It was found that all ozone measurements exhibited the characteristic right-skewed frequency distribution, cyclic pattern, and long-term memory. A mono-fractal analysis was performed by transferring the ozone concentration time series (OCTS) into a useful compact form, namely, the box-dimension (D-B)-threshold (T-h) and critical scale (C-S)-threshold (T-h) plots. Scale invariance was found in these time series and the box dimension was shown to be a decreasing function of the threshold ozone level, implying the existence of multifractal characteristics. To test this hypothesis, the OCTS were transferred into the multifractal spectra, namely, the tau(q)-q plots. The analysis confirmed the existence of multifractal characteristics in the investigated OCTS. A simple two-scale Cantor set with unequal scales and weights was then used to fit the calculated T(q)-q plots. This model fitted remarkably well the entire spectrum of scaling exponents for the examined OCTS. Because the existence of chaos behavior in OCTS has been reported in the literature, the possibility of a chaotic multifractal approach for OCTS characterization was discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study intends to explore the spatial analytical methods to identify both general trends and more subtle patterns of urban land changes. Landsat imagery of metropolitan Kansas City, USA was used to generate time series of land cover data over the past three decades. Based on remotely sensed land cover data, landscape metrics were calculated. Both the remotely sensed data and landscape metrics were used to characterize long-term trends and patterns of urban sprawl. Land cover change analyses at the metropolitan, county, and city levels reveal that over the past three decades the significant increase of built-up land in the study area was mainly at the expense of non-forest vegetation cover. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of the land cover changes allowed the identification of fast and slow sprawling areas. The landscape metrics were analyzed across jurisdictional levels to understand the effects of the built-up expansion on the forestland and non-forest vegetation cover. The results of the analysis suggest that at the metropolitan level both the areas of non-forest vegetation and the forestland became more fragmented due to development while large forest patches were less affected. Metrics statistics show that this landscape effect occurred moderately at the county level, while it could be only weakly identified at the city level, suggesting a scale effect that the landscape response of urbanization can be better revealed within larger spatial units (e.g., a metropolitan area or a county as compared to a city). The interpretation of the built-up patch density metrics helped identify different stages of urbanization in two major urban sprawl directions of the metropolitan area. Land consumption indices (LCI) were devised to relate the remotely sensed built-up growth to changes in housing and commercial constructions as major driving factors, providing an effective measure to compare and characterize urban sprawl across jurisdictional boundaries and time periods.

AB Objectives To estimate the prevalence of HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis in injecting drug users (IDUs) in Russia. Methods Unlinked anonymous cross-sectional survey of 1473 IDUs recruited from non-treatment settings in Moscow, Volgograd and Barnaul (Siberia), with oral fluid sample collection for HIV, HCV antibody (anti-HIV, anti-HCV) and syphilis testing. Results Prevalence of antibody to HIV was 14% in Moscow, 3% in Volgograd and 9% in Barnaul. HCV prevalence was 67% in Moscow, 70% in Volgograd and 54% in Barnaul. Prevalence of positive syphilis serology was 8% in Moscow, 20% in Volgograd and 6% in Barnaul. Half of those HIV positive and a third of those HCV positive were unaware of their positive status. Common risk factors associated with HIV and HCV infection across the cities included both direct and indirect sharing of injecting equipment and injection of home-produced drugs. Among environmental risk factors, we found increased odds of anti-HIV associated with being in prison in Moscow, and some association between official registration as a drug user and anti-HIV and anti-HCV. No associations were found between sexual risk behaviours and anti-HIV in any city. Conclusions HIV prevalence among IDUs was markedly higher than city routine surveillance data suggests and at potentially critical levels in terms of HIV prevention in two cities. HCV prevalence was high in all cities. Syphilis prevalence highlights the potential for sexual risk and sexual HIV transmission. Despite large-scale testing programmes, knowledge of positive status was poor. The scaling-up of harm reduction for IDUs in Russia, including sexual risk reduction, is an urgent priority.

AB Many objects and events, such as cities, firms and internet hubs, scale with size(1-4) in the upper tails of their distributions. Despite intense interest in using power laws to characterize such distributions, most analyses have been concerned with observations at a single instant of time, with little analysis of objects or events that change in size through time ( notwithstanding some significant exceptions(5-7)). It is now clear that the evident macro-stability in such distributions at different times can mask a volatile and often turbulent micro-dynamics, in which objects can change their position or rank-order rapidly while their aggregate distribution appears quite stable. Here I introduce a graphical representation termed the 'rank clock' to examine such dynamics for three distributions: the size of cities in the US from AD 1790, the UK from AD1901 and the world from 430 BC. Our results destroy any notion that rank - size scaling is universal: at the micro-level, these clocks show cities and civilizations rising and falling in size at many times and on many scales. The conventional model explaining such scaling on the basis of growth by proportionate effect cannot replicate these micro-dynamics, suggesting that such models and explanations are considerably less general than has hitherto been assumed.

AB Centrality has revealed crucial for understanding the structural properties of complex relational networks. Centrality is also relevant for various spatial factors affecting human life and behaviors in cities. Here, we present a comprehensive study of centrality distributions over geographic networks of urban streets. Five different measures of centrality, namely degree, closeness, betweenness, straightness and information, are compared over 18 1-square-mile samples of different world cities. Samples are represented by primal geographic graphs, i.e., valued graphs defined by metric rather than topologic distance where intersections are turned into nodes and streets into edges. The spatial behavior of centrality indices over the networks is investigated graphically by means of color-coded maps. The results indicate that a spatial analysis, that we term multiple centrality assessment, grounded not on a single but on a set of different centrality indices, allows an extended comprehension of the city structure, nicely capturing the skeleton of most central routes and subareas that so much impacts on spatial cognition and on collective dynamical behaviors. Statistically, closeness, straightness and betweenness turn out to follow similar functional distribution in all cases, despite the extreme diversity of the considered cities. Conversely, information is found to be exponential in planned cities and to follow a power-law scaling in self-organized cities. Hierarchical clustering analysis, based either on the Gini coefficients of the centrality distributions, or on the correlation between different centrality measures, is able to characterize classes of cities.
