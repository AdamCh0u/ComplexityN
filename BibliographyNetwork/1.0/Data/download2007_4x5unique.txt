AB This paper presents a spatial-temporal downscaling approach to describe the linkage between large-scale climate variables for daily scale to annual maximum (AM) precipitations for daily and sub-daily scales at a local site. More specifically, the proposed approach is based on a combination of a spatial downscaling method to link large-scale climate variables as provided by General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations with daily extreme precipitations at a local site and a temporal downscaling procedure to describe the relationships between daily extreme precipitations with sub-daily extreme precipitations using the scaling General Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. The feasibility of the proposed downscaling method has been tested based on climate simulation outputs from two GCMs under the A2 scenario (HadCM3A2 and CGCM2A2) and using available AM precipitation data for durations ranging from 5 minutes to 1 day at 15 raingage stations in Quebec (Canada) for the 1961-1990 period. Results of this numerical application has indicated that it is feasible to link large-scale climate predictors for daily scale given by GCM simulation outputs with daily and sub-daily AM precipitations at a local site. Furthermore, it was found that AM precipitations at a local site downscaled from the HadCM3A2 displayed a small change in the future, while those values estimated from the CGCM2A2 indicated a large increasing trend for future periods.

AB Two types of porous Miocene limestones; a fine-grained, a medium-grained oolitic were studied on monuments that are located in the polluted urban environment of Budapest. The surface alteration is characterized by the presence of very common white (thin and thick) and less abundant black (laminar and framboidal) weathering crusts. Flaking, scaling and blistering are common crust detachment forms. The exposed weaker surface below the crusts often shows granular disintegration. Non-destructive in situ tests such as Schmidt hammer rebound and Duroscope were used to assess the physical properties of the weathered surfaces. These tests clearly document the presence of thin and thick weathering crusts and the degradation of underlying fine- and medium-grained limestones. A textural change is marked by pore occluding calcite and reduction of porosity in the crust zone, which was also recorded by Karsten-tube measurements. The analyses have demonstrated that the air pollution related gypsum crystallization with combination of freeze/thaw weathering lead to crust detachment with rates strongly controlled by the micro-fabric of limestone substrate.

AB Between 1995 and 2004, regional political elites in Andhra Pradesh sought to transform greater Hyderabad into a dynamic economic region oriented toward global growth sectors. Inspired by the infrastructure-led growth model, a dominant strategy consisted in fitting out, via public-private partnerships, specialised business/technology parks and attracting investment through carefully designed industrial policies. This study focuses on regional IT policies, with attention to the strategic use of peri-urban space and examines the construction of HITEC City and other large-scale projects. Using a multi-level perspective, the Hyderabad case is contextualised in relation to India's recent adoption of economic reforms. Recent literature on global city-regions and the development of global capitalism provides a macro framework for analysing the role of a provincial government both in initiating and driving industrial and urban dynamics. State re-scaling or re-territorialisation in particular is a compelling concept for interpreting the strategies examined here, which aim to promote the competitive advantages of Hyderabad in global economic processes by adapting institutional and regulatory infrastructures. At the micro level, the analysis focuses on how policies are played out in peri-urban spaces, and the implications for urban governance are discussed. Although economic strategies have been fairly successful, top-down decision-making practices have effectively excluded many local actors from the policy process, and the creation of special purpose enclaves in suburban areas has weakened prospects for the development of governance institutions at the metropolitan scale.

AB Objective: The aim of this work was to estimate the present periodontal problems of people in China, based on an epidemiological investigation of adults.
   Material and Methods: The data were collected from the northwest, southwest, northeast and east regions (400 subjects from each region) of China. All subjects were over 25 years of age. About half of the subjects were farmers and about half were urban professionals. Everyone was asked to fill out a questionnaire and to undergo a professional oral examination. Periodontal health status was evaluated by a simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S), gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment loss (CAL), and tooth mobility.
   Results: Of the 1590 subjects enrolled in this investigation, 45.7% were male, 45.5% were farmers, and the remaining were urban professionals, and 27.7% of the subjects were smokers. There was a significant difference in the educational background but not smoking between the rural and urban groups. While 34.9% of the subjects in the urban group brushed only once per day, 56.1% of the subjects in the rural group did so. The prevalence of bleeding during brushing was 71.1%, while about 61.4% of the subjects know nothing about scaling. All periodontal indices were significantly higher in males than in females and higher in the rural group than in the urban group. PD, CAL and tooth mobility increased with age. The percentage of sites with CAL > 3 mm in the rural group (49.5%) was significantly higher than that in the urban group (37.5%). Both current and former smokers showed increased CAL than non-smokers.
   Conclusion: Gingivitis and periodontitis are common findings in China. Most Chinese have no knowledge of common periodontal prevention and treatment and very few have regular dental care. The data of this study suggest that age, smoking, and limited education are significantly associated with Chinese adult periodontal attachment loss. Preventive periodontal care and education should be reinforced in the future by establishing relevant oral health projects.

AB The city of Melbourne, Australia is experiencing a water crisis with potable water storage reservoirs at an all time low. With increasing urbanisation there is an ever increasing need to research and explore sustainable water management initiatives. There is potential to minimise the negative impacts of stormwater runoff and augment dwindling supplies of potable water through adoption of pervious paving technology. The traditional approach to stormwater management has focused on constructing drainage networks to carry stormwater away from developed areas as quickly as possible to avoid the risk of flooding. The main aim of this research project was to establish relationships between rainfall intensity, infiltration rate and pervious pavement runoff and to examine the improvement to stormwater quality after infiltrating through pervious pavements. This paper describes the laboratory experiment set-up to determine the infiltration patterns and stormwater quality improvement for simulated storms precipitating on pervious pavements. Next, the scaling-up of the experimental rig to a field-based trial is explained. Preliminary results from this work are presented to demonstrate the potential benefits of pervious pavements in the Australian landscape.
