AB Urban street patterns form planar networks whose empirical properties cannot be accounted for by simple models such as regular grids or Voronoi tesselations. Striking statistical regularities across different cities have been recently empirically found, suggesting that a general and detail-independent mechanism may be in action. We propose a simple model based on a local optimization process combined with ideas previously proposed in studies of leaf pattern formation. The statistical properties of this model are in good agreement with the observed empirical patterns. Our results thus suggest that in the absence of a global design strategy, the evolution of many different transportation networks indeed follows a simple universal mechanism.

AB Background: Delivery of two doses of intermittent preventive treatment of malaria during pregnancy (IPTp) is a key strategy to reduce the burden of malaria in pregnancy in sub-Saharan Africa. However, different settings have reported coverage levels well below the target 80%. Antenatal implementation guidelines in Tanzania recommend IPTp first dose to be given at the second antenatal visit, and second dose at the third visit. This investigation measured coverage of IPTp at national level in Tanzania and examined the role of individual, facility, and policy level influences on achieved coverage.
   Methods: Three national household and linked reproductive and child health (RCH) facility surveys were conducted July-August 2005, 2006, and 2007 in 210 clusters sampled using two-stage cluster sampling from 21 randomly selected districts. Female residents who reported a livebirth in the previous year were asked questions about malaria prevention during that pregnancy and individual characteristics including education, pregnancy history, and marital status. The RCH facility serving each cluster was also surveyed, and information collected about drug stocks, health education delivery, and the timing of antenatal care delivery by clinic users.
   Results: The national IPTp coverage had declined over the survey period being 71% for first dose in 2005 falling to 65% in 2007 (chi(2) 2.9, p = 0.05), and 38% for second dose in 2005 but 30% in 2007 (chi(2) 4.4, p = 0.01). There was no evidence of any individual factors being associated with second dose coverage beyond living in an urban area. Availability of sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine at RCH had decreased year on year from 85% of clinics in stock in 2005 to 60% in 2007 (chi(2) 20.6, p < 0.001). This reduction was evident in rural but not urban clinics. If safety recommendations and national antenatal care guidelines for IPTp delivery were followed, in 2007 only 76% of pregnant women could have received IPTp first dose and only 46% could have received second dose.
   Conclusion: There is scope to improve IPTp first and second dose coverage at national scale within existing systems by improving stock at RCH, and by revising the existing guidelines to recommend delivery of IPTp after quickening, rather than at a pre-defined antenatal visit.

AB The usefulness of underutilized crops is widely recognised in their contribution to poverty alleviation. Underutilized crops - those that are not staple or mainstream industrial species - feature high in the diet and daily consumption for nutritional, medicinal, energy or other purposes of the rural and urban poor. Promoting underutilized crops contributes to the stability and risk management of farming systems, the conservation of agro biodiversity, but also to strengthening the cultural identity and local empowerment of farmers in the use of what is too often labelled as "backward" and "unmodern". Underutilized crops also form a reservoir of species and varieties readily available to be selected by the market for medium or large up scaling of the production. The potential of many of these species to enter domestic, regional or even international markets is high. Development of stronger links with the private sector and civil society in particular in the commercialisation of underutilized crops for and by smallholder producers, thereby integrating three dimensions of sustainability - People, Planet and Profit (social, ecological and economic sustainability), can provide useful lessons. Projects demonstrate that with entrepreneurship, strong and fair partnerships between producers, dealers, consumers and other stakeholders in the production to consumption chain, and through a participatory integrated learning approach by all partners, commercialisation of underutilized crops can work for poor people. However, these examples are few and it is expected that more efficient underutilized crop promotion will result in increased impact potential of these species.

AB Aim Estimates of abundances and densities of birds and mammals have often been shown to be scale dependent, in that population sizes over large areas are overestimated if extrapolated from surveys of small plots. Previous tests of the mechanisms suggested to cause this decelerating scaling pattern found evidence of a biased choice of small plots in patches of homogeneous habitat. Here we show that negative density-area relationships can also arise as result of not considering plots where individuals of the species or assemblage of interest are absent in surveys of differing spatial resolution.
   Location We took a complete census of violets (Viola spp.) in 800 m(2) of chalk grassland in Wye, Kent, UK, and used human population censuses for Finnish, Swiss and Italian municipalities, English districts, states of the USA and European countries.
   Methods We used mixed models of logarithmically transformed number of individuals or densities as a function of area.
   Results The census of violets shows that by increasing the survey resolution and by not considering plots without individuals, the effectively occupied area diminishes and a negative density-area relationship arises. The finding that negative density-area relationships are also common for people is evidence that the non-random choice of plots in population surveys of varying areas can be responsible for many observed negative density-area relationships. The shallower slope of the people-administrative area relationship for Switzerland and Finland compared with Italy, as well as for England and the USA compared with Europe, confirms that less than proportionate individuals-area relationships can be the consequence of larger plot areas containing a higher proportion of areas without individuals.
   Main conclusions Densities should be reported together with the effective areas for which they were estimated. It should be clearly conveyed whether or not plots where the surveyed species was absent were included in the density estimation.
