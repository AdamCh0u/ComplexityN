AB Recent data from the World Health Organization showed that about 60% of all deaths, occurring among children aged less than five years (under-five children) in developing Countries, Could be attributed to malnutrition. It has been estimated that nearly 50.6 million under-five children are malnourished, and almost 90% of these children are from developing countries. Bangladesh is one of the countries with the highest rate of malnutrition. The recent baseline survey by the National Nutrition Programme (NNP) showed high rates of stunting, underweight, and wasting. However, data from the nutrition surveillance at the ICDDR,B hospital showed that the proportion of children with stunting, underweight, and wasting has actually reduced during 1984-2005. Inappropriate infant and Young child-feeding practices (breastfeeding and complementary feeding) have been identified as a major cause of malnutrition. In Bangladesh, although the median duration of breastfeeding is about 30 months, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding until the first six months of life is low, and practice of appropriate complementary feeding is not satisfactory. Different surveys done by the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and Bangladesh Breastfeeding Foundation (BBF) showed a rate of exclusive breastfeeding to be around 32-52%, which have actually remained same or declined over time. The NNP baseline survey using a strict definition of exclusive breastfeeding showed a rate of exclusive breastfeeding (12.8%) until six months of age. Another study from the Abhoynagar field site of ICDDR,B reported the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding to be 15% only. Considerable efforts have been made to improve the rates of exclusive breastfeeding. Nationally, initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth, feeding colostrum, and exclusive breastfeeding have been promoted through the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) implemented and supported by BBF and UNICEF respectively. Since most (87-91%) deliveries take place in home, the BFHI has a limited impact on the breastfeeding practices. Results of a few studies done at ICDDR,B and elsewhere in developing countries showed that the breastfeeding peer-counselling method Could substantially increase the rates of exclusive breastfeeding. Results of a study in urban Dhaka showed that the rate of exclusive breastfeeding was 70% among mothers who were counselled compared to only 61% who were not counselled. Results of another Study in rural Bangladesh showed that peer-counselling given either individually or in a group improved the rate of exclusive breastfeeding from 89% to 81% compared to those mothers who received regular health messages only. This implies that scaling up peer-counselling methods and incorporation of breastfeeding counselling in the existing maternal and child heath programme is needed to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of improving child survival. The recent data showed that the prevalence of starting complementary food among infants aged 6-9 months had increased substantially with 76% in the current dataset. However, the adequacy, frequency, and energy density of the complementary food are in question. Remarkable advances have been made in the hospital management of severely-malnourished children. The protocolized management of severe protein-energy malnutrition at the Dhaka hospital of ICDDR,B has reduced the rate of hospital mortality by 50%.
   A recent study at ICDDR,B has also documented that home-based management of severe protein-energy malnutrition wthout follow-up was comparable with a hospital-based protocolized management. Although the community nutrition centres of the NNP have been providing food supplementation and performing growth monitoring of children with protein-energy malnutrition, the referral system and management of complicated severely-malnourished children are still not in place.

AB An important issue in the study of cities is defining a metropolitan area, because different definitions affect conclusions regarding the statistical distribution of urban activity. A commonly employed method of defining a metropolitan area is the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), based on rules attempting to capture the notion of city as a functional economic region, and it is performed by using experience. The construction of MSAs is a time-consuming process and is typically done only for a subset (a few hundreds) of the most highly populated cities. Here, we introduce a method to designate metropolitan areas, denoted "City Clustering Algorithm" (CCA). The CCA is based on spatial distributions of the population at a fine geographic scale, defining a city beyond the scope of its administrative boundaries. We use the CCA to examine Gibrat's law of proportional growth, which postulates that the mean and standard deviation of the growth rate of cities are constant, independent of city size. We find that the mean growth rate of a cluster by utilizing the CCA exhibits deviations from Gibrat's law, and that the standard deviation decreases as a power law with respect to the city size. The CCA allows for the study of the underlying process leading to these deviations, which are shown to arise from the existence of long-range spatial correlations in population growth. These results have sociopolitical implications, for example, for the location of new economic development in cities of varied size.

AB On-site greywater reclamation is thought to enhance water usage efficiency and decrease urban water demand. Direct membrane filtration is an attractive approach for treatment of greywater in residential areas due to its small footprint and high reliability, as product quality is insensitive to fluctuations in inflow quality. The research evaluated coagulation or chlorination as possible pretreatments for ultrafiltration followed by RO desalination. The system was fed with "light" greywater (avg. TOC, TN and P - 24.9, 4.6 and 0.7 mg L-1; turbidity - 34 NTU). Direct filtration, without pretreatment, resulted in sharp decrease of the OF permeability, due to organic fouling and biofouling. The RO membrane was suspected for phosphate salt scaling. To overcome these drawbacks, coagulation and chlorination were evaluated as pretreatment options prior to U F. Chlorine demand of the greywater was 10-20 mg L-1. Applying this dose and controlling residual chlorine in the OF feed, lowered the fouling rate by 33%. Mass balances calculations indicated that chlorination inhibited microbial activity in the OF system. The partial oxidation of the organic matter, achieved by the chlorination pretreatment, may have changed the properties of the organic matter and thus its reactivity with the OF and RO membranes. Next, ferric chloride was tested as a coagulant. Dosing 50 mg L-1 ferric chloride reduced the OF flux decline rate by 43%, mainly due to a 38% decrease of the organic load. After coagulation, larger particles with narrower size distribution were observed in the feed (average size similar to 0.5 mu m). This upward shift resulted in a more porous filtration cake buildup on the OF membrane, a finding which supports the enhanced performance. Although a positive synergistic effect could be anticipated, the combined coagulation-chlorination process increased fouling rate in the RO membrane probably due to the increase in the concentration polarization phenomenon, as a result of a rise in the concentrations of counter ions associated with the pretreatment reactants and possible surplus of the latter. The results indicate that greywater pretreatment is a prerequisite to hamper OF membrane biofouling. Coagulation was found to be superior to chlorination for the UF. Effluents produced by each of the membranal steps were of excellent quality that can be used for various purposes, being low in organic content, suspended matter and colloids (UF), or desalinated (RO).

AB This paper introduces a methodology that permits presentation of the results of data envelopment analysis (DEA) graphically. A specialized form of multi-dimensional scaling, Co-Plot, enables presentation of the DEA results in a two-dimensional space, hence in a clear, understandable manner. When plotting ratios rather than original data, DEA efficient units can be visualized clearly, as well as their connections to specific variables and/or ratios. Furthermore, Co-Plot can be used in an exploratory data analysis to identify outliers, whose data require additional scrutiny, and potentially inconsequential variables that could be aggregated or removed from the analysis with little effect on the subsequent DEA results.
   The Co-Plot diagram of ratios presents super-efficient observations on an outer ring or sector of the plot and all reasonably efficient units on a slightly inner ring/sector, surrounding the remaining inefficient decision-making units. First, the well-known 35 Chinese Cities dataset is provided as an illustration. Second, a simulation study tests the applicability of Co-Plot to present the results of DEA. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

ID ALGORITHM
AB We propose novel pixel dense modeling of motion of urban traffic in noisy environments with the help of multidimensional Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). In our approach there is no need for object tracking in order to detect anomalous motion or to model and visualize the fluctuation of traffic. We propose a new scaling method introduced into the HMM to get a robust tool for the analysis of hundreds of motion vector samples at a time. We show the use of our model with a photorealistic video synthetized from real life recordings.
