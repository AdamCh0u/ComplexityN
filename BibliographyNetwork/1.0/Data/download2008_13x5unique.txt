AB Objective: To assess the infant feeding components of prevention of mother to child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programmes.
   Methods: Assessments were performed across Botswana, Kenya, Malawi and Uganda. 29 districts offering PMTCT were selected by stratified random sampling with rural and urban strata. All health facilities in the selected PMTCT district were assessed. The facility level manager and the senior nurse in charge of maternal care were interviewed. 334 randomly selected health workers involved in the PMTCT programme completed self-administered questionnaires. 640 PMTCT counselling observations were carried out and 34 focus groups were conducted amongst men and women.
   Results: Most health workers (234/334, 70%) were unable to correctly estimate the transmission risks of breastfeeding irrespective of exposure to PMTCT training. Infant feeding options were mentioned in 307 of 640 (48%) observations of PMTCT counselling sessions, and in only 35 (5.5%) were infant feeding issues discussed in any depth; of these 19 (54.3%) were rated as poor. Several health workers also reported receiving free samples of infant formula in contravention of the International Code on Breastmilk Substitutes. National HIV managers stated they were unsure about infant feeding policy in the context of HIV. Finally, there was an almost universal belief that an HIV positive mother who breastfeeds her child will always infect the child and intentional avoidance of breastfeeding by the mother indicates that she is HIV positive.
   Conclusion: These findings underline the need to implement and support systematic infant feeding policies and programme responses in the context of HIV programmes.

AB Considerable effort has been made over the past decade to address the needs of learners in large urban districts through scaleable reform initiatives. We examine the effects of a multifaceted scaling reform that focuses on supporting standards based science teaching in urban middle schools. The effort was one component of a systemic reform effort in the Detroit Public Schools, and was centered on highly specified and developed project-based inquiry science units supported by aligned professional development and learning technologies. Two cohorts of 7th and 8th graders that participated in the project units are compared with the remainder of the district population, using results from the high-stakes state standardized test in science. Both the initial and scaled up cohorts show increases in science content understanding and process skills over their peers, and significantly higher pass rates on the statewide test. The relative gains occur up to a year and a half after participation in the curriculum, and show little attenuation with in the second cohort when scaling occurred and the number of teachers involved increased. The effect of participation in units at different grade levels is independent and cumulative, with higher levels of participation associated with similarly higher achievement scores. Examination of results by gender reveals that the curriculum effort succeeds in reducing the gender gap in achievement experienced by urban African-American boys. These findings demonstrate that standards-based, inquiry science curriculum can lead to standardized achievement test gains in historically underserved urban students, when the curriculum is highly specified, developed, and aligned with professional development and administrative support.

AB Mental health service research can require the selection of representative geographical areas for data collection. This study designed and tested a new method of combining different relevant selection criteria within the context of a survey of housing services for people with mental health disorders in England.
   Six criteria were considered relevant to select areas for the survey: deprivation, urban-ness, provision of community mental health care, residential care provision, total mental health care spend and pressure on housing generally. A measure was identified for each criterion and established for each of 166 local areas. Variables were converted to standardised scores and multi-dimensional scaling undertaken to produce a single axis representing all six variables. Study sites were chosen from this. Identifying the spread of the constituent variables among the finally selected areas we established how successfully the resulting selection represented each of the selection criteria. Reliability analyses were performed on the rank positions of each area.
   The measures were converted into one axis, and all areas were ranked according to the score on that specifically developed new axis. The scores on the axis showed good reliability when single criteria were eliminated from the equation. The finally selected six areas demonstrated a reasonable spread of scores of each of the constituent variables.
   Converting several relevant criteria into one score is a feasible approach to ranking geographical areas to assist in identifying small samples that are arguably representative. The method may be used widely in similar research, but requires the availability of reliable data on relevant selection criteria.

AB Axial Graphs are networks whose nodes are linear axes in urban space, and whose edges represent intersections of such axes. These graphs are used in urban planning and urban morphology studies. In this paper we analyse distance distributions between nodes in axial graphs, and show that these distributions are well approximated by rescaled-Poisson distributions. We then demonstrate a correlation between the parameters governing the distance distribution and the degree of the polynomial distribution of metric lengths of linear axes in cities. This correlation provides 'topological' support to the metrically based categorisation of cities proposed in [R. Carvalho, A. Penn, Scaling and universality in the micro-structure of urban space, Physica A 332 (2004) 539-547]. Finally, we attempt to explain this topologico-metric categorisation in functional terms. To this end, we introduce a notion of attraction cores defined in terms of aggregations of random walk agents. We demonstrate that the number of attraction cores in cities correlates with the parameters governing their distance and line length distributions. The intersection of all the three points of view (topological, metric and agent based) yields a descriptive model of the structure of urban networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A simple physics-based mathematical model is developed for prediction of the propagation of a grass-fire front driven by an ambient wind and by entrainment winds generated from one or more burning structures. This model accounts for the heterogeneous nature of the burning in a particular wildland-urban-interface (WUI) setting, where the entrainment from fundamentally three-dimensional structure-fire plumes can change the propagation of a two-dimensional ground-fire front. Data on grass fires and estimates of structure fires are presented and compared to justify the model. Scaling effects on the fire-front propagation-speed are given as a function of the location of the front, of the heat release rate of a single burning structure, of the total number of burning structures and of the burning-structure density. Also, detailed front propagation changes due to a single and multiple burning-house scenarios are presented.
