AB Persistence in hourly ground level ozone concentration observed during 2006 at two sites in Delhi is analyzed using rescaled range analysis based on Hurst exponent estimation. The analysis is carried out separately for whole data series and monthly time series to investigate the seasonal effects on the results of the analysis. High intermittence in the original ozone concentrations at traffic site and in the differenced ozone concentration at both traffic and mixed-use site is observed. The results showed break in the scaling behavior with persistence up to 5 days in the ozone concentration over 2006. The differencing however purged the persistence property. For the monthly observations, persistence is observed up to 2 days. In the monthly time series also, differencing resulted in low persistence as compared to original one during all the months at two sites except during July and August at traffic site, where random behavior is observed. This is mainly attributed to high and intermittent concentration of ozone due to high VOC emissions. Except these months, the behavior of ozone pollution in the observed period is observed to be causal and governed by the temporal dependence on the previous ozone levels and atmospheric processes. The results indicated the differencing has significant effect on the persistence property of the time series. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All fights reserved.

AB OBJECTIVE To assess the impact of a behaviour change communication (BCC) intervention on qualified medical care-seeking for sick newborns in urban Lucknow, northern India.
   METHODS Before and after intervention study conducted at two urban public hospitals at Lucknow. Neonates who did not have any morbidity or congenital malformation and were residents of Lucknow were enrolled within 48 h of birth and followed once between 6 and 8 weeks at the outpatients' clinic or home to assess the primary outcome measure which was qualified medical care-seeking for any neonatal illness. Mothers in the after-intervention phase received BCC intervention at enrolment, targeted at identification of danger signs of neonatal illnesses and promotion of qualified medical care-seeking. Analysis was by intention to treat.
   RESULTS In the before-intervention phase, 510 neonates were enrolled (from March 2007 to August 2007) and 481 (94.3%) were followed up. In the after-intervention phase, 510 neonates were enrolled (September 2007-April 2008) and 490 (96.1%) were followed up. Neonatal morbidity was 50.3% (242/481) and 44.3% (217/490) in before and after intervention phases, respectively. Qualified medical care-seeking for neonatal illnesses was significantly higher among mothers after-intervention (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 1.42-3.16; P = 0.0001).
   CONCLUSION Since the behaviour change intervention package led to significant improvement in qualified medical care-seeking for sick newborns, this may be tested for effectiveness in other settings and considered for scaling up here, with rising proportion of institutional deliveries.

TI The global pharmacy workforce: a systematic review of the literature

DT Review
ID NONPRACTICING PHARMACISTS; PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES; REGISTER; JOINERS;

AB The importance of health workforce provision has gained significance and is now considered one of the most pressing issues worldwide, across all health professions. Against this background, the objectives of the work presented here were to systematically explore and identify contemporary issues surrounding expansion of the global pharmacy workforce in order to assist the
   International Pharmaceutical Federation working group on the workforce. International peer and non-peer-reviewed literature published between January 1998 and February 2008 was analysed. Articles were collated by performing searches of appropriate databases and reference lists of relevant articles; in addition, key informants were contacted. Information that met specific quality standards and pertained to the pharmacy workforce was extracted to matrices and assigned an evidence grade.
   Sixty-nine papers were identified for inclusion (48 peer reviewed and 21 non-peer-reviewed). Evaluation of evidence revealed the global pharmacy workforce to be composed of increasing numbers of females who were working fewer hours; this decreased their overall full-time equivalent contribution to the workforce, compared to male pharmacists. Distribution of pharmacists was uneven with respect to location (urban/rural, less-developed/ more-developed countries) and work sector (private/public). Graduates showed a preference for completing pre-registration training near where they studied as an undergraduate; this was of considerable importance to rural areas. Increases in the number of pharmacy student enrolments and pharmacy schools occurred alongside an expansion in the number and roles of pharmacy technicians. Increased international awareness and support existed for the certification, registration and regulation of pharmacy technicians and accreditation of training courses. The most common factors adding to the demand for pharmacists were increased feminization, clinical governance measures, complexity of medication therapy and increased prescriptions.
   To maintain and expand the future pharmacy workforce, increases in recruitment and retention will be essential, as will decreases in attrition, where possible. However, scaling up the global pharmacy workforce is a complex, multifactorial responsibility that requires coordinated action. Further research by means of prospective and comparative methods, not only surveys, is needed into feminization; decreasing demand for postgraduate training; graduate trends; job satisfaction and the impact of pharmacy technicians; and how effective existing interventions are at expanding the pharmacy workforce. More coordinated monitoring and modelling of the pharmacy workforce worldwide (particularly in developing countries) is required.

AB In this study, we developed an HIV transmission risk scale and examined its psychometric properties using data on sexual behavior obtained from a probability sample of adult men who have sex with men living in Chicago. We used Messick's (Am Psychol 50:741-749, 1995) conceptualization of unified validity theory to organize the psychometric properties of data. Evidence related to scale content was investigated via Rasch item fit statistics, point-measure correlations, and expert evaluation. The substantive aspect of validity was addressed by interpreting the meaningfulness of the item difficulty hierarchy (continuum of risky behaviors) and assessment of person fit. The structural aspect of validity was assessed using Rasch item fit statistics, principal component analysis of standardized residuals, and other residual analyses. The generalizability aspect of validity was investigated via internal consistency reliability estimates for both items and persons, and aspects of external validity were addressed by examining between-group differences with respect to levels of risky behavior. Applications and suggested future studies are discussed.

AB Proper management of technical risks during blasting facilitates efficient project management and helps keeping costs and safety at an acceptable level. it is of crucial importance to incorporate the process of risk management in the design and execution of the project. Risk analyses of the environmental effect of blast-induced vibrations are, in many cases, based on crude concepts which do not take into consideration the fundamental nature of vibratory motion. Realistic modeling of wave propagation in soil and rock requires that correct dynamic parameters are considered and appropriate attenuation models are applied. It is possible to apply relatively simple vibration attenuation concepts for prediction of vibrations in soil and rock and their interaction with structures on or below the ground surface.
