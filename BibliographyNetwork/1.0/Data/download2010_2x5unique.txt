AB What are the benefits of society? What are the adaptive advantages of social behavior? The fact that societies exist suggest that society favors synergies in the interactions between individuals. One such synergy or adaptive advantage might be the increased efficiency in the use of scarce resources. This has been postulated to occur in the "metabolic scaling law", where larger organisms with more cells consume less energy per unit mass than smaller organisms. Here, I develop a similar scale-free index for social synergy applicable to energy consumption, and apply it to social insect colonies and human cities. The results show that all societies studied increase the efficiency of energy consumption with increased sizes. This study shows that social synergy is reliably quantifiable and that its increase with size is much larger in social insects than that observed with the metabolic scaling law in organisms. This allows for the first time to compare quantitatively very different societies, permitting novel studies in social dynamics, for example, the study shows that termite colonies achieve much higher social synergy than ant and honey bee colonies and that Brazilian cities achieve more social synergy than Danish or North American ones, posing new intriguing questions.

AB One of Aesop's (La Fontain's) famous fables 'The Ant and the Grasshopper' is widely known to give a moral lesson through comparison between the hard working ant and the party-loving grasshopper. Here we show a slightly different version of this fable, namely, "The Ant and the Metrohopper", which describes human mobility patterns in modern urban life. Numerous real transportation networks and the trajectory data have been studied in order to understand mobility patterns. We study trajectories of commuters on the public transportation of Metropolitan Seoul, Korea. Smart cards (Integrated Circuit Cards; ICCs) are used in the public transportation system, which allow collection of transit transaction data, including departure and arrival stations and time. This empirical analysis provides human mobility patterns, which impact traffic forecasting and transportation optimization, as well as urban planning.

AB Background: KwaZulu-Natal is the South African province worst affected by HIV and the focus of early modeling studies investigating strategies of antiretroviral treatment (ART) delivery. The reality of antiretroviral roll-out through primary care has differed from that anticipated and real world data are needed to inform the planning of further scaling up of services. We investigated the factors associated with uptake of antiretroviral treatment through a primary healthcare system in rural South Africa.
   Methods: Detailed demographic, HIV surveillance and geographic information system (GIS) data were used to estimate the proportion of HIV positive adults accessing antiretroviral treatment within northern KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa in the period from initiation of antiretroviral roll-out until the end of 2008. Demographic, spatial and socioeconomic factors influencing the likelihood of individuals accessing antiretroviral treatment were explored using multivariable analysis.
   Results: Mean uptake of ART among HIV positive resident adults was 21.0% (95%CI 20.1-21.9). Uptake among HIV positive men (19.2%) was slightly lower than women (21.8%, P = 0.011). An individual's likelihood of accessing ART was not associated with level of education, household assets or urban/rural locale. ART uptake was strongly negatively associated with distance from the nearest primary healthcare facility (aOR = 0.728 per square-root transformed km, 95%CI 0.658-0.963, P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Despite concerns about the equitable nature of antiretroviral treatment rollout, we find very few differences in ART uptake across a range of socio-demographic variables in a rural South African population. However, even when socio-demographic factors were taken into account, individuals living further away from primary healthcare clinics were still significantly less likely to be accessing ART

AB As huge complex systems consisting of geographic regions, natural resources, people and economic entities, countries follow the allometric scaling law which is ubiquitous in ecological, and urban systems. We systematically investigated the allometric scaling relationships between a large number of macroscopic properties and geographic (area), demographic (population) and economic (GDP, gross domestic production) sizes of countries respectively. We found that most of the economic, trade, energy consumption, communication related properties have significant super-linear (the exponent is larger than 1) or nearly linear allometric scaling relations with the GDP. Meanwhile, the geographic (arable area, natural resources, etc.), demographic (labor force, military age population, etc.) and transportation-related properties (road length, airports) have significant and sub-linear (the exponent is smaller than 1) allometric scaling relations with area. Several differences of power law relations with respect to the population between countries and cities were pointed out. First, population increases sub-linearly with area in countries. Second, the GDP increases linearly in countries but not super-linearly as in cities. Finally, electricity or oil consumption per capita increases with population faster than cities.

TI Scaling of the urban heat island effect based on the energy balance:
   nighttime minimum temperature increase vs. urban area length scale
SO CLIMATE RESEARCH
LA English
DT Article
DE Urban heat island; Scaling; Energy balance; Urbanized land surface area
ID PHOENIX; CLIMATE; FEATURES; CITIES; FORM; USA
AB One of the adverse results of urbanization is the urban heat island (UHI) effect, wherein a combination of various factors renders the temperatures in an urban region higher than in the surroundings. We examined the UHI effect in 2 cities: Phoenix and Tucson (Arizona, USA), with disparate length scales but similar meteorological conditions. Based on analyses of both the urbanized land surface areal growth and thermal energy balance, a correlation appears wherein the nighttime minimum temperature (an indicator of the UHI effect) is seen to follow the square-root of the area, or the length scale of the urbanized land area. Using thermal energy transport for the air mass above the urbanized area, this scaling can be explained by a time-dependent energy balance, which shows that the rate of decrease in temperature also scales linearly with the length scale of the urban area. Viewed in this perspective, the length scale of an urbanized area is an important parameter in determining the severity of the UHI effects, as the advection rate is diminished when the length scale of the urban area is increased. Based on this scaling, the UHI effect, as indicated by nighttime temperature deviations from undisturbed levels, will tend to increase as the square-root of the urbanized area due to the advection rate effect.
