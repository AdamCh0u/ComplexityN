AB In recent years, many automotive navigation systems have been developed estimating the position and motion of a vehicle by combining GNSS measurements with data from other sensors, such as inertial sensors or odometers. The usage of measurements provided by attached sensors and/or the vehicle's CAN-bus not only improves the GNSS solution but also enables dead reckoning during periods of GNSS unavailability. This paper describes an embedded solution of Sensor Fusion Dead Reckoning (SFDR) utilizing a low-cost single-frequency GNSS receiver and MEMS gyroscope + wheel tick (GWT) information.
   On the basis of tick and gyroscope measurements from a single wheel the vehicle speed and heading rate can be calculated. In order to achieve optimal dead reckoning performance, the GNSS and sensor measurements are combined using a tightly-coupled extended Kalman filter allowing for continuous and automatic calibration of unknown sensor parameters, such as bias and scaling factor of the gyroscope and the scaling factor for the wheel ticks representing the wheel's radius. Since the temperature dependent drift of the gyroscope bias during GNSS outages can degrade the dead reckoning performance significantly, the temperature and gyroscope bias are simultaneously measured during vehicle halt and a Temperature Compensation Table (TCT) is updated continuously.
   The performance of the presented low-cost "gyro + wheel tick" solution is evaluated by means of road tests carried out with a specially equipped test vehicle comprising a high-precision navigation system used as reference. Numerous road tests with different driving scenarios under varying environmental conditions were carried out, such as fast drive on a curved freeway, slow driving maneuvers in an underground parking garage, drive through tunnels and urban canyons. In addition, a large number of GNSS outages were simulated in order to study, improve and tune the dead reckoning performance as well as to analyze its accuracies statistically. The GWT results are also compared to the Differential Wheel Tick (DWT) Dead Reckoning technology, which derives the heading rate from the tick measurements of the left and right wheel. First statistical analyses show that the GWT dead reckoning solution performs more than twice as accurate as the DWT solution. In addition, GWT sensor fusion significantly outperforms a GPS-only solution, especially in difficult environments, such as urban canyons.

AB In the last few years, Tushka area received a special attention from the Egyptian government to construct new projects, cities and cultivation of more new areas. No historical earthquakes are known in the Tushka area. The spectral analysis was performed to obtain the source parameters of some earthquakes with magnitude MD ranging between 2.0 and 3.7 located in and around the area. The source parameters were determined using the MAG software program. The derived corner frequency f(o) for P- and S-waves show values between 3.9-10.7 and 3.7-12.5 Hz respectively, the seismic moment M-o ranged from 7.77 x 10(11) to 1.77 x 10(14) dyne/cm, the source radii r spanned from 49.2 to 136.5 m, the stress drop Delta delta varied from 1.17 to 778.3 bar and the seismic energy E ranged from 6.42 x 105 to 1.24 x 10(11) J.
   Some scaling relations between the different obtained source parameters were made such as: M-o-M-D M-o-Delta delta, M-o-E, and moment magnitude M-w-M-D in order to deduce the empirical relations for these parameters that can help in turn in the fast calculation of the different source parameters for the earthquakes in the area.

AB The classification of places as either urban or rural is typically based on an absolute threshold of population and/or population density. However, conceptual definitions of urbanization and urbanicity encompass dimensions beyond solely population size and population density. Multiple important distinguishing urban characteristics beyond population size have been described. The crude classification of places as urban or rural coupled with infrequent updates to this information creates a measure that is prone to misclassification error. An improved measure of urbanicity would draw information from the domains that characterize urban and rural places, would be sensitive to changes over time, and would represent gradations on the continuum from rural to urban environments. The goal of the current study was to develop such a scale from existing data, test whether the scale was reliable and valid, and assess whether it provided information beyond what could be determined from the traditional urban/rural dichotomous variable. We utilized established scaling procedures from the psychometric literature to construct and evaluate a multicomponent scale to measure urban features on a continuum in China. We also provided an example of its potential contribution to health research by examining its relationship with the adult body mass index (BMI). Because the scale was constructed and tested using established scaling procedures and using a wide array of variables, it represents an improvement over previous attempts at such a scale and will provide a reliable and valid measurement tool for researchers in this arena. We demonstrate that the scale predicts the incidence of overweight/obesity populations in China, but it promises to be most useful for other economic, demographic, social welfare, and health outcomes.

AB Allometric scaling relations are characteristic of all living organisms. Metabolic and heart rates, lifespan and many other physiological properties vary with body mass in systematic and interrelated ways, which usually take the form of a power law. Scaling laws have been recently observed also in the metabolic rate of a particular kind of living system: the city. Scaling exponents of urban indicators present a remarkable variability, mainly associated with fundamentally different underlying dynamics. In this paper allometric scaling is used to detect dissimilar behaviors in one particularly important urban indicator: electricity consumption. Different scaling relations between electricity consumption and economical and social sectors found in southern Spain region of Andalucia, indicate variability in these sectors' basal energy consumption processes. The usefulness of these findings for urban modeling is finally outlined and some practical implications are suggested.

ID DIMENSION; BRUSSELS
AB Fractal dimension is an index which can be used to characterize urban areas. The use of the curve of scaling behaviour is less common. However, its shape gives local information about the morphology of the built-up area. This paper suggests a method based on a k-medoid for clustering these curves. It is applied to forty-nine wards of European cities, and shows that the curves add interesting intraward information to our knowledge of the spatial variation of the urban texture. Moreover, morphological similarities are observed between cities: living, architectural, and planning trends are not specific to individual cities.
