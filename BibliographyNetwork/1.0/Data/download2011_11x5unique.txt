AB The Alliance for Healthy Cities is an international network of cities and organizations aiming at protecting and enhancing the health of city dwellers. It was founded by following the global movement of Healthy Cities and scaling up this movement in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization. To cope with the adverse effects of an urban environment on health, the network encourages information sharing within cities and between cities, both nationally and internationally. This network emphasizes learning from diversity; city-to-city exchanges; exchanges of experiences in various sectors/levels; sharing practical procedures; learning from communities; recognition of, and learning from, good practices and progress; sharing evidence based on actual practices and scientific evaluation; linking global and local agendas; and international activities to expand capacities in local settings. Evaluation by the members of this network was carried out to identify progress in cities, the advantages of being part of a network, measures to strengthen Healthy Cities initiatives, and areas for research by taking advantage of a network of Healthy Cities. Activities of the network have expanded the interests of various stakeholders at the local, national, and international levels, and have involved government, academic, community, and private sectors.

AB Background: Avahan, the India AIDS Initiative, delivers HIV prevention services to high-risk populations at scale. Although the broad costs of such HIV interventions are known, to-date there has been little data available on the comparative costs of reaching different target groups, including female sex workers (FSWs), replace with 'high risk men who have sex with men (HR-MSM) and trans-genders.
   Methods: Costs are estimated for the first three years of Avahan scale up differentiated by typology of female sex workers (brothel, street, home, lodge based, bar based), HR-MSM and transgenders in urban districts in India: Mumbai and Thane in Maharashtra and Bangalore in Karnataka. Financial and economic costs were collected prospectively from a provider perspective. Outputs were measured using data collected by the Avahan programme. Costs are presented in US$2008.
   Results: Costs were found to vary substantially by target group. Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working with transgender populations had a higher mean cost (US $116) per person reached compared to those dealing primarily with FSWs (US $75-96) and MSWs (US $90) by the end of year three of the programme in Mumbai. The mean cost of delivering the intervention to HR-MSMs (US $42) was higher than delivering it to FSWs (US $37) in Bangalore. The package of services delivered to each target group was similar, and our results suggest that cost variation is related to the target population size, the intensity of the programme (in terms of number of contacts made per year) and a number of specific issues related to each target group.
   Conclusions: Based on our data policy makers and program managers need to consider the ease of accessing high risk population when planning and budgeting for HIV prevention services for these populations and avoid funding programmes on the basis of target population size alone.

AB Background: This paper explores injection drug users' (IDUs) relationships with non-drug using family members in order to understand the potential opportunities for, and challenges to, having these family members provide harm reduction services (e.g., clean syringes).
   Methods: The qualitative data for this paper were drawn from a larger study of IDUs' relationships with key individuals in their lives (e.g., friends, family members). Interviews were conducted with 115 IDUs from across Atlantic Canada living in both urban and rural areas.
   Results: IDUs report that their relationships with family members are variable and dynamic, often changing over time. IDUs and family members engage in a variety of strategies to protect themselves from the multiple harms associated with drug use. Several strategies of self-protection (e.g., discontinuing all contact) are antithetical to the provision of harm reduction supports by family members. However, other strategies are based on continued contact, providing a potential opportunity for the integration of harm reduction approaches. Some family members not only have contact but provide supports (e.g., emotional support, housing) thus potentially facilitating the integration of harm reduction. In a few instances, family members already provide harm reduction supports (e.g., safe space to use).
   Conclusions: Conceptualizing addictions as a health and social justice issue, and providing appropriate interventions, may reduce some of the harms experienced by users and family members thus encouraging sustained relationships and greater integration of harm reduction approaches into the relationship. Targeted education to family members about harm reduction may also further encourage their involvement in such efforts. Likewise, supporting family members who are already providing harm reduction supports will likely assist in the scaling-up of harm reduction efforts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The aerosol vertical distribution is an important factor in determining the relationship between satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) and ground-level fine particle pollution concentrations. We evaluate how aerosol profiles measured by ground-based lidar and simulated by models can help improve the association between AOD retrieved by the Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and fine particle sulfate (SO4) concentrations using matched data at two lidar sites. At the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) site, both lidar and model aerosol profiles marginally improve the association between SO4 concentrations and MISR fractional AODs, as the correlation coefficient between cross-validation (CV) and observed SO4 concentrations changes from 0.87 for the no-scaling model to 0.88 for models scaled with aerosol vertical profiles. At the GSFC site, a large amount of urban aerosols resides in the well-mixed boundary layer so the column fractional AODs are already excellent indicators of ground-level particle pollution. In contrast, at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) site with relatively low aerosol loadings, scaling substantially improves model performance. The correlation coefficient between CV and observed SO4 concentrations is increased from 0.58 for the no-scaling model to 0.76 in the GEOS-Chem scaling model, and the model bias is reduced from 17% to 9%. In summary, despite the inaccuracy due to the coarse horizontal resolution and the challenges of simulating turbulent mixing in the boundary layer, GEOS-Chem simulated aerosol profiles can still improve methods for estimating surface aerosol (504) mass from satellite-based AODs, particularly in rural areas where aerosols in the free troposphere and any long-range transport of aerosols can significantly contribute to the column AOD.

AB In this paper, we present an empirical investigation on 12 urban subway networks in Asia, which include main urban subway networks in China, Japan, Korea, India, Thailand and Singapore. The size of these networks ranges from N=47 to 455. The clustering coefficient, the character path length and the degree distribution have been analyzed. The empirical results show that these networks have high clustering coefficient (C>0.80) and small character path length (L<3.0), which exhibit a small-world behavior (in space p). The empirical studies from different times show that the clustering coefficient C gradually decreases with the increase of the total number of subway stops N, but the characteristic path length L increases, both following a power law. In addition, we also have studied the fractal scaling of these networks and find that these subway networks exhibit some properties of fractal scaling networks.
