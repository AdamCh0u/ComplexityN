AB Knowledge about ecophysiological attitudes at tree level is basic for a correct knowledge of the performance of each species in different environments, and for the comprehension of the mitigation and compensation aspects that urban vegetation may exert. Data on photosynthesis and stomata conductance may be obtained from measurements at single leaf level, but their upscaling to plant level is very complex, due to the needs of considering light extinction patterns within complex canopies, and all the other regulatory physiological and physical factors. This paper starts from the opposite direction: scaling down information about single trees photosynthesis from data collected at stand level.

AB Epidemiological studies of health effects associated with ambient air pollution are subject to uncertainty in the effects estimates related to the spatial and temporal variability of ambient air pollution. This study examines meteorological and concentration decay data for an urban canopy in Oklahoma City, OK to develop a modeling approach that can be used to estimate spatiotemporal variability in contaminant retention that could add bias or uncertainty to epidemiological results. Concentration and microscale turbulent wind data from the Joint Urban 2003 study were reanalyzed to examine scaling relationships between contaminant residence time in urban street canyons, urban boundary layer winds, and urban topography. Street-level sulfur hexafluoride (SF(6)) concentration time series were reviewed to find time periods that included a peak and decay. Exponential decay curves were fitted to each period, and a characteristic residence time was derived from each model slope. That residence time was nondimensionalized by the ratio of mean urban boundary layer wind speed to height of the building just upwind of the street canyon in which the concentration was measured. Sonic detection and ranging (SODAR) data were used to assess atmospheric turbulence conditions at times concurrent with the concentration decay measurements. Reynolds number (Re) was calculated from the 15-min average wind velocity and ranged from 2.1 x 10(6) to 7.6 x 10(7). Nondimensional residence time (H) ranged from 3.7 to 996 with a median of 13.3. Inverse relationships were validated between H and Re and between H and the street canyon aspect ratio. These relationships provided a mechanism to understand time-varying ventilation within a street canyon. The results shown here were intended to demonstrate how scaling relationships derived from the transport equation can be used to provide rapid estimates of characteristic decay times for the purpose of estimating variability in the concentrations encountered in an urban environment. This could be a useful tool to reduce uncertainty in air pollution epidemiological study results related to spatial and temporal variability in urban concentrations. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Measuring social capital is main issues for sociologist and politicians after widespread of it. The other issue is increasing aged population in developing countries. The study was conducted to respond to this issues and developing a relevant scale of social capital for aged people. Literatures were reviewed and indicators of social capital estimated for aged as well. Operational items evaluated among 768 elder samples upon cluster-ratio sampling in eight districts of Khuzistan province in Iran. The findings suggested the acceptance of social capital's items for aged to illustrate their situations in social sphere and items of scale upon Cronbach's alpha are validated as well. There are differences within its categories of rural-urban and ethnicity that warn policies for seniors in society.

AB The relationships between the size, scale, shape, and dimension of urban settlements are basic problems remained to be further resolved, and this paper provides an available perspective for understanding these problems. Based on the standard circle, the relations between the fractal dimension of urban boundary and the compactness ratios of urban shape were derived from a geometric measure relation in a simple way. The compactness ratios proved to be the exponential functions of the reciprocal of the boundary dimension. The results can be generalized and applied to the common indices of shape including circularity ratio, ellipticity index, and form ratio, which are defined by urban area, perimeter, or Feret's diameter. The mathematical models are empirically verified by the remote sensing data of China's 31 megacities in 1990 and 2000 and lend support to the assumption that urban boundaries are pre-fractals rather than real fractals. A conclusion can be drawn that there exist certain functional relations between the shape indices and the boundary dimension, and within certain range of scales, the fractal parameters can be indirectly estimated by the ratios of size measurements to reflect the features of urban shapes.

AB Aims: The current study aimed at undertaking an investigation to describe health-related quality of life (HRQL) in Chinese people, with a Mandarin version of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) validated. Methods: A total of 3,219 respondents were successfully interviewed under a randomized stratified multi-stage sampling design from April 2007 to January 2008 in five cities of mainland China. Self-finished interview method was applied and the Mandarin version of SF-36 was used for assessing HRQL. Results: As a result, the reliability and validity of SF-36 were acceptable, although some deviations from the hypothesized model still existed. The Chinese population scored higher than other populations in five of the eight SF-36 scales and Chinese men scored higher than women in six of the eight SF-36 scales. Conclusions: Basically, the Mandarin version of SF-36 is a reliable instrument, although minor modifications are needed. The health-related quality of life in Chinese people were quite high based on the sample of five cities in China; further research is needed to establish the countrywide norm of health-related quality of life in mainland China.
