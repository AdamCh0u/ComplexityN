TI How do flow peaks and durations change in suburbanizing semi-arid
   watersheds? A southern California case study

AB Forty-three US Geological Survey gauges with records greater than 15 yrs located in watersheds less than similar to 250 km(2) were used to model the effects of suburbanization on streams in semi-arid southern California. The watersheds spanned a gradient of urban development, ranging 0-23% total impervious area in 2001. With little flow control at the subdivision scale, most impervious area in the region is relatively well-connected to surface-drainage networks and hydrologically effective. Consequently, total impervious area was an effective hydrologic surrogate for urbanization, emerging from an expansive array of geospatially-derived hydrologic variables as a statistically-significant (p < 0.05) predictor of instantaneous peak-flow rates at the 1.5- and 2-yr recurrence intervals and the durations of all geomorphically-important flows. To represent the effects of urbanization on flow durations, we developed duration density functions by using power functions (typical R-2 > 0.95) to predict occurrence of logarithmically-binned mean daily discharges greater than some nominal value. This approach expands on previous scaling procedures to produce histogram-style cumulative flow durations for ungauged sites using urbanization extent and other watershed descriptors. For a particular watershed size and climatic setting, urbanization resulted in proportionally-longer durations of all geomorphically-effective flows, with a more pronounced effect on the durations of moderate flows. For example, a representative watershed with similar to 20% imperviousness could experience five times as many days of mean daily flows on the order of 100 cfs (3 m(3)/s) and approximately three times as many days on the order of 1000 cfs (30 m(3)/s) relative to the undeveloped setting. Increased duration of sediment-transporting flows is a primary driver of accelerated changes in channel form that are often concurrent with urbanization throughout southern California, particularly in unconfined, fine-grained geomorphic settings. We did not have comparable studies on flow durations from other regions; however, the peak factors presented herein (e.g., sixfold increase in Q(2) at 20% imperviousness) are greater than studies from humid temperate regions suggesting that semi-arid regimes may be more susceptible to urbanization than other climatic settings.

AB This study examines patterns of secular change in cranial morphology in the New Lisbon collection, a documented skeletal collection from Lisbon, Portugal with birth years from 1806 to 1954. This period represents a time when Lisbon was undergoing increased urbanization and population growth, as well as changes in mortality and fertility patterns. Previous studies from the U.S., Europe, and Japan have reported significant secular changes in cranial morphology over the past 200 years. In the current study, secular changes were analyzed using three-dimensional geometric morphometrics methods. The results from this study demonstrate a significant change in cranial morphology over the roughly 150-year period. Allometry was rejected as a causal factor of this change because there was no association found between temporal change and size. The pattern of temporal change is similar to that observed in other populations in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including decreased facial breadth and a more inferiorly placed cranial base. This study, along with previous research, suggests a similar pattern of change occurs in genetically and geographically diverse populations experiencing modern environmental conditions. We argue that because the secular changes are focused in the cranial base, a region of the skull that experiences a relatively early growth curve, changes related to declines in childhood morbidity and mortality are likely important factors related to the observed changes.

AB In this study, chemometric methods were applied to fingerprint heavy metals in surface water in Tahtali Basin, Turkey, and were found to assist water managers in determining drinking water quality. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine pollutant sources governing water quality, and Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) was used to identify spatial differences in the basin. Results showed that the level of heavy metals found in surface water was predominantly influenced by urban runoff (mainly in residential areas) and agricultural runoff. However, heavy metal concentrations were found to be lower than the threshold values set by European drinking water standards. Therefore, heavy metal levels in surface water were "acceptable" for a drinking water supply. This study showed that chemometric methods can assist water managers fingerprinting surface water quality.

AB Biological indicators can be used both to estimate ecological condition and to suggest plausible causes of ecosystem degradation across the U.S. Great Lakes coastal region. Here we use data on breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities to develop robust indicators of ecological condition of the U.S. Lake Superior coastal zone. Sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region, covering gradients of anthropogenic stress defined by over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, altered land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). A total of 89 locations in Lake Superior were sampled between 2001 and 2004 including 31 sites for stable isotope analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates, 62 sites for birds, 35 for diatoms, 32 for fish and macroinvertebrates, and 26 for wetland vegetation. A relationship between watershed disturbance metrics and (15)N levels in coastal macroinvertebrates confirmed that watershed-based stressor gradients are expressed across Lake Superior's coastal ecosystems, increasing confidence in ascribing causes of biological responses to some landscape activities. Several landscape metrics in particular-agriculture, urbanization, human population density, and road density-strongly influenced the responses of indicator species assemblages. Conditions were generally good in Lake Superior, but in some areas watershed stressors produced degraded conditions that were similar to those in the southern and eastern U.S. Great Lakes. The following indicators were developed based on biotic responses to stress in Lake Superior in the context of all the Great Lakes: (1) an index of ecological condition for breeding bird communities, (2) diatom-based nutrient and solids indicators, (3) fish and macroinvertebrate indicators for coastal wetlands, and (4) a non-metric multidimensional scaling for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These biotic measures serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Superior coast; collectively, they provide a baseline assessment of selected biological conditions for the U.S. Lake Superior coastal region and prescribe a means to detect change over time.

AB Seasonal and spatial variation in the genotypic richness of 3480 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from the Yeongsan River basin in South Korea was investigated by using the horizontal fluorophore-enhanced rep-PCR (HFERP) DNA fingerprinting technique. The relationship between 60 E. coli isolates from each of 58 freshwater samples was determined by using multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis and self-organized maps (SOMs). The MDS analysis, done based on HFERP DNA fingerprints, showed that E. coli isolates obtained in October through December clustered tightly, while those obtained in other sampling periods were more genetically diverse. However, site-specific E. coli genotypes were not observed. SOMs analysis, done using the 10 most frequently isolated E. coli genotypes, showed the occurrence of season-specific E. coli genotypes and the main SOMs clusters were most influenced by temperature, strain diversity and biochemical oxygen demand. Diversity among E. coli genotypes tended to decrease as water temperature decreased, and the numbers of E. coli genotypes observed in urban area were greater, more diverse and less dependent on water temperature than those obtained from agricultural areas. Taken together, our findings indicate that that an ecological approach needs to be considered in order to obtain a better understanding of E. coli community dynamics in the environment and that SOMs analysis is useful to visualize the multidimensional dependent variables that are influencing the types and dynamics of specific E. coli genotypes in the environment.
