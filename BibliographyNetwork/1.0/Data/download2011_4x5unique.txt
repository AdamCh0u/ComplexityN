AB The stress induced in the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus, by boat presence and type was investigated in a highly urbanized coastal environment, the Port Adelaide River-Barker Inlet Estuary, South Australia. The level of stress experienced by bottlenose dolphins was inferred from the distribution patterns of their dive durations. Dive duration has previously been shown to increase under boat traffic conditions, and is considered as a typical avoidance behavior. Dive durations were opportunistically recorded from land-based stations between January 2008 and October 2010 in the absence of boat traffic, and in the presence of kayaks, inflatable motor boats, powerboats and fishing boats. Subsequent analyses were based on nearly 6000 behavioral observations. No significant differences in dive durations were found between control observations (i.e. absence of boats) and boat interferences, which could erroneously lead to conclude that boat traffic did not induce any stress in T. aduncus. In contrast, the scaling exponents of the cumulative probability distribution of dive durations obtained in the absence of boat traffic and under different conditions of boat interferences show (i) that the presence of boats affected the complexity of dive duration patterns and (ii) that stress levels were a function of boat type. Specifically, the complexity of dive duration patterns (estimated by the scaling exponent phi) did not significantly differ between control behavioral observations and behavioral observations conducted in the presence of kayaks. A significant increased in behavioral stress (i.e. decreasing values of phi) was, however, induced by the presence of fishing boats, motorized inflatable boats and powerboats. This demonstrates that traditional approaches based on the analysis of averaged behavioral metrics may not be sensitive enough to detect changes in the distribution pattern of behavioral sequences, hence underestimate the potential consequences of e.g. chronic exposure to low levels of stress. It is finally emphasized that fractal analyses of behavioral variables, and in particular the analysis of their cumulative probability distribution function, may provide a non-invasive, objective and quantitative framework that can be used to assess the changes in stress response, and subsequently evaluate the welfare status of organisms under various conditions of abiotic and/or biotic stress.

TI Effective solutions for rural electrification in developing countries:
   Lessons from successful programs
SO CURRENT OPINION IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
LA English
DT Review
AB Countries embarking on providing electricity to their poorest populations face significant challenges. One is deciding how to create or modify existing institutions and policies to support rural electrification initiatives. Existing electricity companies often have a tradition of serving mostly urban populations and thus may be reluctant to support rural electrification programs. Scaling up electricity access in rural areas may require creating independent institutions or setting up special programs within electricity companies. Complementary solutions, involving both grid and offgrid approaches, may be needed. Grid extension should be pursued as a least-cost option in more densely populated and economically advanced areas, where power demand and load densities are high [1]. Where grid extension is not least-cost or reaching remote communities through grid network expansion is economically impractical, offgrid technologies and business models involving renewable energy or even small diesel systems should be adopted to provide basic levels of electricity service.

AB The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is applied to study the long-range correlations of urban fires in both small and large spatial scales with a case of Chinese city. It is found that the time series of direct economic loss caused by urban fires presents stable anti-power law correlations, while the time interval series of urban fire occurrence presents persistent long-range power-law correlations with two scaling exponents. Based on the characteristics of these scaling exponents, the intrinsic dynamics of urban fires is discussed in terms of the effect of human activities on the long-range correlation patterns of urban fire system.

AB Background: Our intention was to analyze demographic and contextual factors associated with sexual risk taking among HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral treatment (ART) in Africa's largest informal urban settlement, Kibera in Nairobi, Kenya.
   Methods: We used a cross-sectional survey in a resource-poor, urban informal settlement in Nairobi; 515 consecutive adult patients on ART attending the African Medical and Research Foundation clinic in Kibera in Nairobi were included in the study. Interviewers used structured questionnaires covering socio-demographic characteristics, time on ART, number of sexual partners during the previous six months and consistency of condom use.
   Results: Twenty-eight percent of patients reported inconsistent condom use. Female patients were significantly more likely than men to report inconsistent condom use (aOR 3.03; 95% CI 1.60-5.72). Shorter time on ART was significantly associated with inconsistent condom use. Multiple sexual partners were more common among married men than among married women (adjusted OR 4.38; 95% CI 1.82-10.51).
   Conclusions: Inconsistent condom use was especially common among women and patients who had recently started ART, i.e., when the risk of HIV transmission is higher. Having multiple partners was quite common, especially among married men, with the potential of creating sexual networks and an increased risk of HIV transmission. ART needs to be accompanied by other preventive interventions to reduce the risk of new HIV infections among sero-discordant couples and to increase overall community effectiveness.

AB In this paper, we study the application of geomorphology in planning. Since geomorphology is a science about the changes in land features and geomorphic planning is a science that helps us find the best solutions for present land use problems. Geomorphology uses different time scales for planning issues. Short term time scaling includes a 10 to 50 year period through which this science can play a significant role in issues such as site selection of many land uses. Urban site selection, urban morphology, industrial and waste disposal site selection are among these land uses. We have carried out research for a solid waste disposal site selection as a case study and the city of Bonab has been chosen as the study region. This city has located in the southern part of East Azerbaijan Province, at 46 ':5 '' eastern longitude and 37 ':20 '' northern latitude. The topographic situation of the region, ecologic and economic problems with the current location of the waste disposal site (such as its neighboring with faults, its proximity to surface waters and industrial establishments and the steep slope of the area) have been the reasons of study. These issues necessitate thorough investigations for waste disposal site selection in this region. The focus of this research is on demonstrating the application and the importance of geomorphic studies in planning. We have considered geomorphic factors and sub-factors like rock, soil, slope, faults and unstable lands. In addition, ecologic and socio-economic factors and the element of hydro-climate have also been considered. Using digital maps of the region and GIS software (Arc View and ArcGIS), we have tried to determine the most appropriate waste disposal site with the least ecological, social and economic threats. Using this method, we have selected 9 appropriate sites for waste disposal. The aim was choosing an optimum solid waste site. The site proposed is located on the south-east of the city, 7 km from Malekan. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
