AB Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are increasingly the vehicles of choice for the implementation of information and communications technology in the developing world. This is particularly true with regard to locally appropriate, shared-access models such as the telecenter franchise. However, the sustainability and the scalability of such initiatives remain in question. This article examines an innovative PPP project at a crucial developmental point: the period of transition from pilot to scaling stage. It identifies challenges and success factors seldom covered in the literature on such projects, then addresses the question(s) of sustainability and scalability, and explores the advantages of focussing on sub-urban areas and the small-and-medium-enterprise sector of emerging economies.

AB To help ensure the security of water supply to urban catchments, a popular policy choice is to promote the installation of domestic rainwater tanks. While yield is primarily considered, this policy also causes a change in urban-runoff stormwater volumes and consequentially, nutrient export.
   Modelling tools are used to predict the yield, volumetric reliability, overflow volume, and nutrient export that the deployment of rainwater tanks will cause. These modelling tools commonly utilise an up-scaling approach to analyse the behaviour of multiple tanks, where the performance of a single tank with average characteristics is linearly scaled up to represent a larger cluster of tanks.
   Previous research has shown that this up-scaling method significantly overestimates the yield and volumetric reliability (Mitchell et al. 2008), and underestimates the overflow volume of the cluster (Neumann et al. 2011). A sensitivity analysis of the parameters used to represent a rainwater tank (roof catchment areas, tank storage capacities, demand) was carried out, using on-hand data for Melbourne water demand, rainfall and maximum temperature (Neumann et al. 2011). It identified that the non linearity of the tank yield and overflow in relation to some of the model parameters means that the adoption of an "average" (i.e. spatially lumped) tank to represent the behaviour of the entire cluster is subject to significant errors.
   This paper establishes that, accordingly, nutrient export loads are also underestimated, and describes a stochastic water balance and quality model to effectively quantify the overflow nutrient load from a cluster of rainwater tanks at the catchment-scale.
   In 2008, to reduce mains water consumption the South East Queensland region made rainwater tanks mandatory in new detached dwellings. It is important to accurately estimate overflow nutrient loads discharged to stormwater to identify changes at the catchment scale caused by this wide implementation of rainwater tanks.
   The purpose of this paper is to apply the method described in Neumann et al (2011) and Maheepala et al (2011) to South East Queensland data, avoiding the limitations of spatial lumping of the performance of an average rainwater tank. This study examines the impact on overflow loads and volumes, and potable water savings at a catchment scale of a simulated cluster of RWTs in the Brisbane region, and also analyses the model's sensitivity to geographic climate parameters. By using Brisbane water demand, rainfall, and maximum temperature data, this paper illustrates the effect that the varied climates of Melbourne and Brisbane have on the results of the model, via different rainfall and usage patterns.
   The results of this study for the Brisbane Local Government Area indicate an overestimation of volumetric reliability and yield, and an underestimation of the overflow volume and inflow load as well as the outflow load, which varies between 15% and 27%, depending on the nutrient. Therefore it is not recommended to use an average tank to predict the performance of a cluster of household rainwater tanks to find their contribution to potable water savings, overflow volumes and subsequent nutrient and sediment export to stormwater. Instead, we recommend using stochastic simulation of rainwater tanks, which will include the use of probability distributions to represent tank characteristics and stochastic representation of end use water demands, calibrated using local climate and observed demand and rainwater tank data.

AB Many of the decisions relating to future urban development require information on climate change risks to cities This review of the academic and "grey" literature provides an overview assessment of the state of the art in the quantification and valuation of climate risks at the city-scale. We find that whilst a small number of cities, mostly in OECD countries, have derived quantitative estimates of the costs of climate change risks under alternative scenarios, this form of analysis is in its infancy. The climate risks most frequently addressed in existing studies are associated with sea-level rise, health and water resources. Other sectors such as energy, transport, and built infrastructure remain less studied. The review has also undertaken a case study to examine the progress in two cities-London and New York-which are relatively advanced in the assessment of climate risks and adaptation. The case studies show that these cities have benefited from stakeholder engagement at an early stage in their risk assessments. They have also benefited from the development of specific institutional responsibilities for co-ordinating such research from the outset. This involvement has been critical in creating momentum and obtaining resources for subsequent in-depth analysis of sectoral impacts and adaptation needs..While low cost climate down-scaling applications would be useful in future research, the greatest priority is to develop responses that can work within the high future uncertainty of future climate change, to build resilience and maintain flexibility. This can best be used within the context of established risk management practices.

AB Background: We studied virological outcome and drug resistance in patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) in health care centers in the Democratic Republic of Congo and looked for the presence of drug resistance in antiretroviral-naive patients attending the same clinics.
   Methods: In 2008, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among patients on ART for >= 12 months in 4 major cities [Kinshasa (n = 289), Matadi (n = 198), Lubumbashi (n = 77), and Mbuji-Mayi (n = 103)]. Genotypic drug resistance tests were done with an in-house assay on samples with viral load > 1000 copies/mL. ART-naive patients (n = 283) were also consecutively enrolled in the same clinics.
   Results: Of the 667 patients on ART, > 98% received Lamivudine + Stavudine/azidothymidine + Nevirapine/Efavirenz as first-line regimen and 74.4% were women. Median time on ART was 25 months [interquartile ratio (IQR), 19-32] in Kinshasa, 26 months (IQR, 19-32) in Matadi, 27 months (IQR, 19-44) in Lubumbashi, and 19 months (IQR, 16-24) in Mbuji-Mayi. A total of 97 patients (14.6%) had viral load > 1000 copies/mL, and among the 93 successfully sequenced samples, 78 (83.9%) were resistant to at least 1 drug of their ART regimen: 68 harbored resistance mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), 2 to NRTI only, 7 to NNRTI only, and 1 to NRTI + NNRTI + protease inhibitor. The majority of patients, 70/78 (89.7%), were resistant to at least 2 of the 3 drugs from their treatment. The use of next-generation NNRTI, etravirine was already compromised for 19.2% (15/78) of the patients and 7 patients had the K65R mutation compromising the use of tenofovir in second-line regimens. The proportion of antiretroviral-resistant patients increased over time from 8.4% to 18.6% for patients on ART for 12-23 months or > 35 months (P = 0.013), respectively. Virological failure and rates of drug resistance were significantly higher among men than women, 19.9% versus 8.8%, respectively (P = 0.0001). Among the 253 recently diagnosed patients, 20 (7.9%) harbored resistance mutations.
   Conclusions: The accumulation of drug resistance mutations with time on ART needs further attention, and surveillance should be reinforced in ART programs in sub-Saharan Africa.

TI Scaling of prosocial behavior in cities
SO PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
LA English
DT Article
DE Scaling; Cities; Prosocial; Innovation
ID LOST-LETTER TECHNIQUE; NETWORKS
AB Previous research has examined how various behaviors scale in cities in relation to their population sizes. Behavior related to innovation and productivity has been found to increase per capita as the size of the city increases, a phenomenon known as superlinear scaling. Criminal behavior has also been found to scale superlinearly. Here we examine a variety of prosocial behaviors (e.g., voting and organ donation), which also would be presumed to be categorized into a single class of scaling with population. We find that, unlike productivity and innovation, prosocial behaviors do not scale in a unified manner. We argue how this might be due to the nature of interactions that are distinct for different prosocial behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
