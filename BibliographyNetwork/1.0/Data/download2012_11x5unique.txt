AB Soil samples of 0-5cm from 18 sampling sites including different functional zones of Qingdao, China were collected and analyzed. The results showed the average concentration of Cu, Pb, Zn and Ni in soil were up to 55.96,174.37,57.89, and 31.16mg/kg respectively, which were much higher than their natural background values. The average Igeo values were in the increasing order of Ni(0.638) <Pb(1.428)<Cu(1.458)< Zn(3.03). Zn was high contamination, while Pb,Cu were moderated contamination. By hierarchical cluster, eighteen plots could be divided into five groups.(a)(A3,C1),(C4,C5,E1);(b)(B2,E2),(D3,D2);(c)(D1,D4,A2),(A1,C6); (d) (A2,C2),B1; (e)C3; The MDS analysis showed some rules in the graph. From top to bottom of longitudinal axis means low contents to high contents of Cu,Pb. From left to right of horizontal axis means low contents to high contents of Zn. Along the oblique axis, the values of Igeo were from high to low.

AB Introduction: Despite recent advances in the management of HIV infection and increased access to treatment, prevention, care and support, the HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be a major global health problem, with sub-Saharan Africa suffering by far the greatest humanitarian, demographic and socio-economic burden of the epidemic. Information on HIV/AIDS clinical care and established cohorts' characteristics in the Central Africa region are sparse.
   Methods: A survey of clinical care resources, management practices and patient characteristics was undertaken among 12 adult HIV care sites in four countries of the International Epidemiologic Databases to Evaluate AIDS Central Africa (IeDEA-CA) Phase 1 regional network in October 2009. These facilities served predominantly urban populations and offered primary care in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC; six sites), secondary care in Rwanda (two sites) and tertiary care in Cameroon (three sites) and Burundi (one site).
   Results: Despite some variation in facility characteristics, sites reported high levels of monitoring resources, including electronic databases, as well as linkages to prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission programs. At the time of the survey, there were 21,599 HIV-positive adults (median age = 37 years) enrolled in the clinical cohort. Though two-thirds were women, few adults (6.5%) entered HIV care through prevention of mother-to-child transmission services, whereas 55% of the cohort entered care through voluntary counselling and testing. Two-thirds of patients at sites in Cameroon and DRC were in WHO Stage III and IV at baseline, whereas nearly all patients in the Rwanda facilities with clinical stage information available were in Stage I and II. WHO criteria were used for antiretroviral therapy initiation. The most common treatment regimen was stavudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (64%), followed by zidovudine/lamivudine/nevirapine (19%).
   Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of establishing large clinical cohorts of HIV-positive individuals in a relatively short amount of time in spite of challenges experienced by clinics in resource-limited settings such as those in this region. Country differences in the cohort's site and patient characteristics were noted. This information sets the stage for the development of research initiatives and additional programs to enhance adult HIV care and treatment in Central Africa.

AB Long-memory is often observed in time series data. The existence of long-memory in a data set implies that the successive data points are strongly correlated i.e. they remain persistent for quite some time. A commonly used approach in modelling the time series data such as the Box and Jenkins models are no longer appropriate since the assumption of stationary is not satisfied. Thus, the scaling analysis is particularly suitable to be used for identifying the existence of long-memory as well as the extent of persistent data. In this study, an analysis was carried out on the observed daily mean per hour of ozone concentration that were available at six monitoring stations located in the urban areas of Peninsular Malaysia from 1998 to 2006. In order to investigate the existence of long-memory, a preliminary analysis was done based on plots of autocorrelation junction (AcF) of the observed data. Scaling analysis involving five methods which included resealed range, rescaled variance, dispersional, linear and bridge detrending techniques of scaled windowed variance were applied to estimate the Hurst coefficient (H) at each station. The results revealed that the ACF plots indicated a slow decay as the number lag increased. Based on the scaling analysis, the estimated H values lay within 0.7 and 0.9, indicating the existence of long-memory in the ozone time series data. In addition, it was also found that the data were persistent for the period of up to 150 days.

AB As a significant factor in urban planning, traffic forecasting and prediction of epidemics, modeling patterns of human mobility draws intensive attention from researchers for decades. Power-law distribution and its variations are observed from quite a few real-world human mobility datasets such as the movements of banking notes, trackings of cell phone users locations and trajectories of vehicles. In this paper, we build models for 20 million trajectories with fine granularity collected from more than 10 thousand taxis in Beijing. In contrast to most models observed in human mobility data, the taxis' traveling displacements in urban areas tend to follow an exponential distribution instead of a power-law. Similarly, the elapsed time can also be well approximated by an exponential distribution. Worth mentioning, analysis of the interevent time indicates the bursty nature of human mobility, similar to many other human activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB With the growing availability of personal communication devices we are witnessing a tremendous increase in the demand for mobile services based on location and context. Mobile gaming is, of course, following this same trend. Unfortunately, differently from other services, location- and context-based gaming strictly requires near-field communication to interact with nearby players in order to create teams and arenas. Since currently adopted technologies suffer from scalability (Bluetooth) or energy (WiFi) constraints, Opportunistic Networks (ONs) have already been addressed as a viable solution to involve a considerable number of players on a wider area. While massive multiplayer games are commonplace on wired networks, it is not yet clear how player experience is affected by the increased delay and probabilistic message forwarding introduced by a huge population over an ON. In this paper we address this problem by proposing an opportunistic collaborative game, which is meaningful for the category of collaborative puzzle games, and evaluating its playability and scalability by means of simulations on a real city topology.
