AB Motivated by empirical evidence on the interplay between geography, population density and societal interaction, we propose a generative process for the evolution of social structure in cities. Our analytical and simulation results predict both super-linear scaling of social-tie density and information contagion as a function of the population. Here we demonstrate that our model provides a robust and accurate fit for the dependency of city characteristics with city-size, ranging from individual-level dyadic interactions (number of acquaintances, volume of communication) to population level variables (contagious disease rates, patenting activity, economic productivity and crime) without the need to appeal to heterogeneity, modularity, specialization or hierarchy.

AB The diffusion of residential and commercial low-density settlements is a phenomenon observed in both urban and rural areas of Europe irrespective of their development level and urban form. In southern Europe, the socioeconomic and territorial characteristics of regions experiencing sprawl are extremely variegated and need further studies. The comparison of case studies that differ in population size and density, social and economic features, land availability, and local culture may thus provide sound information to overcome the above-mentioned information gap. In the present study, we provided an example of second-home and tourism-driven sprawl occurring in an originally low-density rural area (Mykonos, Greece). The assessment of Mykonos' sprawl was carried out by using statistical data from multiple sources, including the censuses of population, buildings, and agriculture together with land-use and field survey. Results (1) define urban expansion phases in Mykonos, (2) illustrate the peculiarity of this process compared to other paradigmatic Greek areas, and (3) indicate an integrated assessment framework of urban sprawl in originally low-density insular areas. Finally, the economic and environmental implications of urban diffusion in Mykonos at both local and regional scale have been discussed.

AB In order for an underground project to run with good quality and profitability there must be good control of all activities in the tunnel cycle. It is important to understand each activity individually but especially how they affect each other. All activities can affect each other, for example bad scaling affects the safety in drilling, bad charging affects the mucking etc. One of the crucial factors to have a successful project is to have good control of the drilling.
   Why do we need to have good control of the drilling? It doesn't matter if the project is located remotely or in urban areas, whether it is a hydro power project or infrastructure project, they all need drilling application such as drilling for blasting, pre grouting, probe hole, forepoling, spiling etc, and all this equal with precision drilling. Examples of what bad drilling and blasting can effect include: short pulls of the rounds, more rock reinforcement due to damaged rock mass, longer scaling and mucking time, more concrete in lining due to over break, bad control of grouting etc. All these effects are quality and cost related.
   At underground works in urban areas we often get vibration problems from blasting when the tunnels are located close to existing houses, tunnels and other sensitive objects. To be able to blast in hard competent rock close to sensitive areas we need to have a very good control on the amount of explosives and the location of the explosives. For smooth blasting that uses small amounts of explosives in an efficient way we must have good control of the drilling. If drilling or blasting fails in vibration sensitive areas it can have a significant negative impact on the project.
   Computerized drill rigs can provide high precision drilling. The benefits with these types of rigs are that you know exactly where you are and where and how to drill. During the last few years the focus has been on raising the quality and precision on the drilling rigs. Today we can use total station navigation for positioning the drill rig, pre made drill pattern, full automation of the drilling, forecast the rock with MWD (Measure While Drilling) analysis, use rig mounted profiler for scanning the perimeter etc. All these applications contribute to raising the quality and productivity of the project.
   In order to be able to use and get the benefits from the new technology, the users from operator to project management and clients must be trained and informed in how to use the equipment to get good quality and profitability on their projects.

AB Purpose - The proposed paper discusses the role of public institutions in fostering innovation of public services, focussing on the emergent nature of innovation. In particular it analyses the opportunity for urban administrations to play the role of "growers" (i.e. "capturers, ", drivers and facilitators) of scaling-up processes, of urban forces showing innovation potentials and self-organizing ability in facing socio-urban problems. Hence, it explores how public administrators can identify and respond to the real public needs by effectively and responsibly capturing the intrinsic innovative potentials of complex urban systems.
   Design/methodology/approach - Starting from the analysis of the existing literature on the application of the SOC (Self Organized Criticality) theory to socio-urban systems, the paper identifies and discusses some existing cases of SOC-like dynamics in urban contexts having the potential of public services. The paper in particular reflects on the micro-scale nature of promising SOC-like dynamics that can be captured in urban environments to move towards more systemic and structured framework of public services. The SOC theory recognizes that critical conditions in systems produce basic patterns that help in developing new stability frameworks. Coherently with this vision, we assume that nonlinearities in socio-urban SOC systems can be considered potentials to be captured and driven by public institutions towards the reorganisation, hopefully innovation, of public services' frames.
   Originality/value - The originality of the proposed paper is twofold: 1) it does not conform to any theory or approach considering innovation any artefact of planned activity or designed process; 2) it looks at public institutions as crucial capturers of innovation epiphanies and crucial aligners of innovation forces towards creating a new perspective for the implementation of public services.
   Practical implications - Public institutions have to develop relationships of trust and collaboration with and among citizens to be able to capture the SOC dynamic in urban environments and to reframe and shape innovative public services. Therefore, urban administrations should be able to recognize the different situational variables that influence each environmental situation to capture innovation epiphanies. If urban administrations are able to capture the innovation epiphanies deriving from crashing moments of SOC, they could be able to reduce their effects and develop on their potentials. In these perspectives the paper identifies some rules of thumbs, emerging from the analysed cases, considered promising for public institutions to be able to facilitate the emergence of innovative public services in contemporary urban environments.

AB Meeting the competing demands for freshwater of the urban, industrial, and agricultural communities is increasingly challenging as the global population continues to grow and the need for potable water, food, fiber, and fuel grows with it. One of the keys to meeting these demands is maximizing the efficiency of water use in agricultural applications. Toward this end, a thorough understanding of the factors driving evapotranspiration and their response to spatiotemporal variations in local environmental conditions is needed for the development and validation of numerical and remote sensing-based models. Moreover, because these exchange processes are strongly nonlinear, scaling measurements collected at one scale to another remains a nontrivial task. In an effort to identify the key environmental drivers controlling the latent heat flux (lambda E) from agro-ecosystems and their potential impacts on upscaling in-situ flux measurements, eddy covariance and micrometeorological data collected over maize and soy at three distinct sites located in Maryland, Iowa, and Minnesota, respectively were evaluated for the years between 2007 and 2011. The magnitudes of the evaporative fluxes were comparable for measurements collected during clear-sky days with similar environmental conditions; on average, the measurements of lambda E agreed to within 50 W m(-2), or approximately 10%. When considered in terms of evaporative fraction (f(e)), however, there were marked differences among the sites. For example, while the magnitude and diurnal pattern of f(e) for mature maize at the Minnesota site was nearly constant (f(e) = 0.66) during the day, f(e) at both the Maryland and Iowa site increased steadily during the day from a minimum value near 0.68 at midmorning to peak value of 0.87 in the afternoon. These differences appear to be primarily linked to differences in soil moisture and vegetation density at the various sites. As such, this research underscores the impact of local environmental conditions in controlling land-atmosphere exchange processes. It also underscores the importance accurately describing local environmental conditions when modeling surface fluxes. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
