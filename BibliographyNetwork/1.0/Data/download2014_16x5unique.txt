AB This paper describes the research carried out to eliminate the noise found in ECG signal and cardiac rhythm. For this, ECG signals were collected carefully from BIOPAC data acquisition system and MIT-BIH database. MIT-BIH noise stress test database was used for generating realistic noises. In addition, to get a better denoised ECG, Symlet wavelet was chosen because its scaling function is closely related to the shape of ECG. For denoising ECG signal, a novel modified S-median thresholding technique is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The optimal Symlet wavelet of order 6 and decomposition level of 8 are attained for modified S-median thresholding technique. The evaluation results showed that the proposed system performed better than S-median and other existing techniques in the time domain. The frequency domain analysis also showed the preservation of important phenomena of ECG. The scalogram difference of 0.004% indicates the well preservation of time-frequency information.

AB Using data on all scientific publications from the Scopus database, we find a superlinear scaling effect for U. S. metropolitan areas as indicated by the increase of per capita publication output with city size. We also find that the variance of residuals is much higher for mid-sized cities (100,000 to 500,000 inhabitants) compared to larger cities. The latter result is indicative of the critical mass required to establish a scientific center in a particular discipline. Finally, we observe that the largest cities publish much less than the scaling law would predict, indicating that the largest cities are relatively unattractive locations for scientific research.

TI Low-cost wind resource assessment for small-scale turbine installations

AB A two-stage approach to low-cost wind resource assessment for small-scale wind installations has been investigated in terms of its ability to screen for non-viable sites and to provide accurate wind power predictions at promising locations. The approach was implemented as a case study at ten UK locations where domestic-scale turbines were previously installed. In stage one, sites were pre-screened using a boundary-layer scaling model to predict the mean wind power density, including estimated uncertainties, and these predictions were compared to a minimum viability criterion. Using this procedure, five of the seven non-viable sites were correctly identified without direct onsite wind measurements and none of the viable sites were excluded. In stage two, more detailed analysis was carried out using 3 months onsite wind measurements combined with measure-correlate-predict (MCP) approaches. Using this process, the remaining two non-viable sites were identified and the available wind power density at the three viable sites was accurately predicted. The effect of seasonal variability on the MCP-predicted wind resource was considered and the implications for financial projections were highlighted. The study provides a framework for low-cost wind resource assessment in cases where long-term onsite measurements may be too costly or impractical.

   City group ride vehicle project

ID TRANSPORTATION; INNOVATIONS; IMMIGRANTS
AB Many US cities have unsuccessfully experimented with jitney projects to improve transit service, reduce costs, and adapt to shifting demographics. The impetus for this research was to take advantage of a natural policy experiment, the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission's (TLC) Group Ride Vehicle (GRV) Pilot Project, to evaluate why jitneys often fail when regulated to supplement conventional transit The Commission developed the pilot project in response to service cuts on dozens of New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) bus routes throughout the city. These cuts, coupled with higher transit fares, dramatically limited transit access for many city residents. Shortly after the service reductions went into effect in June 2010, the Commission announced the pilot project to bring commuter vans (commuter vans are the licensed jitneys in New York City) to five service areas that lost regular bus service. They expected the project to improve access for New Yorkers and create opportunity for jitney drivers and operators. The pilot project targeted service areas in Brooklyn and Queens, and the Commission received commitments from five existing commuter van operators to participate in the project The project was controversial for multiple reasons, including the City's willingness to privatize formerly public transit service and the imposition of two fares for Group Ride Vehicle riders traveling into Manhattan. The first Group Ride Vehicle began service in September 2010, and despite optimism from operators and the TLC, the program was unofficially discontinued after only a few months.
   Though the pilot project failed to attract riders, it highlighted the importance of commuter vans for transit-dependent populations that rely on them and suggests many challenges to formalizing informal transit in the United States. Using the Group Ride Vehicle project as our starting point, we explore why informal jitneys in the United States succeed, and whether the conditions under which they prosper are compatible with conventional transit operations. Focus groups with operators, unstructured interviews with drivers and riders and participant observation are used to help explain the challenges facing the formalization of jitney services in New York. Our analysis identified four reasons why the GRV project failed: (1) a lack of subsidy to maintain service and build demand, (2) a two-month gap between the service cuts and jitney service implementation, (3) poorly branded service, and (4) confusing language used to describe the program. We argue that some of these factors are more perceived than real, but all of them reflect the difficulty of scaling up a niche jitney service to a general purpose transit service.

AB The size of cities is known to play a fundamental role in social and economic life. Yet, its relation to the structure of the underlying network of human interactions has not been investigated empirically in detail. In this paper, we map society-wide communication networks to the urban areas of two European countries. We show that both the total number of contacts and the total communication activity grow superlinearly with city population size, according to well-defined scaling relations and resulting from a multiplicative increase that affects most citizens. Perhaps surprisingly, however, the probability that an individual's contacts are also connected with each other remains largely unaffected. These empirical results predict a systematic and scale-invariant acceleration of interaction-based spreading phenomena as cities get bigger, which is numerically confirmed by applying epidemiological models to the studied networks. Our findings should provide a microscopic basis towards understanding the superlinear increase of different socioeconomic quantities with city size, that applies to almost all urban systems and includes, for instance, the creation of new inventions or the prevalence of certain contagious diseases.
