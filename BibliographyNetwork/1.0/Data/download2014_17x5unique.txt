AB Drawing on the results of interviews and access to information requests, we explore conservation officer work in two urban regions in one Canadian province (Ontario). Specifically, we examine the work of the federal-level National Capital Commission (NCC) in Ottawa and the provincial-level Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA). Applying Jessop, Brenner and Jones's model of socio-spatial relations, we show how nature plays a different role in NCC and TRCA policing depending on the places their conservation officers work in, the kinds of territorial boundary maintenance in which they engage, the scaling of their activities in various jurisdictions, and the policing networks that they are part of. In assessing the place of nature in conservation officers' work, we contribute to debates about how the boundary between nature and the urban is produced through regulatory practices.

AB The generalized Cobb-Douglas production function has been derived from a general input-output relation based on fractality assumptions. It was proved to be a useful self-affine model for geographical analysis. However, the ordinary least square calculation is always an ineffectual method for the Cobb-Douglas modeling because of the multicollinearity in the logarithmic linear regression. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to build the geographical Cobb-Douglas models. Combining the concept of allometric scaling with the linear regression technique, we obtain a simple algorithm that can be employed to estimate the parameters of the Cobb-Douglas function. As a case, the algorithm and models are applied to the public transportation of China's cities, and the results validate the allometric algorithm. A conclusion can be drawn that the allometric analysis is an effective way of modeling geographical systems with the general Cobb-Douglas function. This study is significant for integrating the notions of allometry, fractals, and scaling into a new framework to form a quantitative methodology of spatial analysis.

AB The combined use of air quality monitoring data and state-of-the art dispersion models provides a more realistic representation of the spatial distribution of pollutants and allows a reduction in the uncertainties involved in the assessment of the exposure in epidemiological studies. Data assimilation is a method which combines such information to produce an optimal representation of the state of the atmosphere. In this work, we tested two approaches to merge these information sets: the successive corrections method (SCM) and the statistical optimal interpolation (OI). These methods have been extended in order to take into account the spatial representativeness of measurements. PM10, NO2, and O-3 concentration fields produced by an air quality modeling system, run with two nested domains covering much of Central Italy and the Rome urban area, have been used to identify the optimal values for the horizontal and vertical scaling distances that are key parameters for the SCM and OI methods. A statistical analysis of the results obtained from the application of these methods demonstrated that lower RMSE values resulted from the use of the OI method. Further, PM2.5 modeling results over the Rome urban area and additional measurements collected during experimental campaigns, performed within the population exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (EXPAH) LIFE+ Project, allowed the evaluation of this approach in reconstructing PM2.5 levels at EXPAH monitoring sites, which were not used in the data assimilation process. The results confirmed the potential of these methods to improve the estimation of modeled concentrations, by taking into account local phenomena not resolved by the model, but clear from the observations, and also in providing more reliable data to be used in exposure studies.

AB The authors have done extensive research in gathering historical background on the subject of flow excited acoustic resonance. They have provided extensive discussion to justify creative formulations for predicting the onset of resonance and estimating the associated maximum pressure amplitudes. Their approach makes use of reported experimental studies plus some of their own to make charts that should be useful for some common industrial problems. An independent scaling approach is offered in this review to verify the dominant parameters and variables employed by the authors in their predictive methods. It was found that for low Mach number flows, a specific Reynolds number (Re) dependence was missing. However, since it is known that the Strouhal dependence is very weak on Reynolds numbers up to about 10(5), the absence of specific Re dependence is probably inconsequential. Another concern was that interaction between the acoustics and vortex shedding or shear layer instabilities could affect the eigen-frequencies. A simple model showed that this is possible, but Quad Cities experience cited by the authors indicated one case where it was not important. The Rolls-Royce Vertical Lift System example with coaxial closed side-branches could have had a significant interaction with the annular liquid mass on eigenmodes. The mass effect resulting from the annular space connecting both branches could act less like an oscillating shear layer and more like a Helmholtz resonator. This could have a significant effect on the natural frequency of either or both branch pipes. Although that effect is not specifically considered here, if it was significant, it would be naturally embraced in a scale model based on the scaling laws presented in this review.

AB Among the many questions raised by the recent abundance of great (M>8.0) subduction thrust earthquakes is their potential to trigger damaging earthquakes on crustal faults within the overriding plate and beneath many of the world's densely populated urban centers. We take advantage of the coincident abundance of great earthquakes globally and instrumental observations since 1960 to assess this triggering potential by analyzing centroids and focal mechanisms from the centroid moment tensor catalog for events starting in 1976 and published reports about the M9.5 1960 Chile and M9.2 1964 Alaska earthquake sequences. We find clear increases in the rates of crustal earthquakes in the overriding plate within days following all subduction thrust earthquakes of M>8.6, within about 10 degrees of the triggering event centroid latitude and longitude. This result is consistent with dynamic triggering of more distant increases of shallow seismicity rates at distances beyond 10 degrees, suggesting that dynamic triggering may be important within the near field too. Crustal earthquake rate increases may also follow smaller M>7.5 subduction thrust events, but because activity typically occurs offshore in the immediately vicinity of the triggering rupture plane, it cannot be unambiguously attributed to sources within the overriding plate. These observations are easily explained in the context of existing earthquake scaling laws.
