DE Sanitation; Waste Management; Policy and Practice; Semi-Urban City;
   Southwest Nigeria
AB Inappropriate waste management and poor sanitation practices have become major concerns in many developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The objectives of this study are to appraise the relevance of institutional policy and practice on sanitation effort with the case study of a semi-urban city in Southwest Nigeria. The study involved the assessment of procedures and techniques available in waste collection, treatment, disposal practices and compliances with institutional rules and regulations. The survey involved the use of structured questionnaires, in-depth interviews, on-site observations and focus group discussions in the various local communities and villages drawn across the 16 wards of the municipality. The data assessed captured social demographic-, housing-, socio cultural-characteristics, sanitation and hygiene behaviour and problems with poor water and sanitation. Both quantitative and qualitative techniques in data collection and analysis were utilized as main instruments. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software application was employed for the purpose of analysis. Responses collected were coded using a linkert scaling procedure. The procedure combines descriptive analysis and bivariate regression estimation in arriving at the results obtained. Results of the study showed that there is no connection between institutional policies and the people's sanitation practices in the communities and more so, the management practices in most communities expose the inhabitants to unnecessary health risks. This has put a challenge on sanitation effort at reaching the Millelium Development Goal (MDG) target. It is therefore recommended, that a sustained cooperation be developed among all key actors (government, waste managers, public health workers and inhabitants) so as to implement an economic, sustainable, safe and reliable sanitation strategy and practices. This should not only be limited to legislation and policy formulation but also in its monitoring and enforcement. In addition, there is need for sensitizing the general public and raising their awareness level on environmental risks associated with poor sanitation practices.

AB Technology scaling enables today the design of sensor-based ultra-low cost chips well suited for emerging applications such as wireless body sensor networks, urban life and environment monitoring. Energy consumption is the key limiting factor of this up-coming revolution and memories are often the energy bottleneck mainly due to leakage power. This paper proposes an ultra-low power multi-core architecture targeting eHealth monitoring systems, where applications involve collection of sequences of slow biomedical signals and highly parallel computations at very low voltage. We propose a hybrid memory architecture that combines 6T-SRAM and 8T-SRAM operating in the same voltage domain and capable of dispatching at high voltage a normal operation and at low voltage a fully reliable small memory partition (8T) while the rest of the memory (6T) is state-retentive. Our architecture offers significant energy savings with a low area overhead in typical eHealth Compressed Sensingbased applications.

DE vulnerable families; placement prevention; family participation;
   resilience based tool
AB P.I.P.P.I. is a research-training-intervention program funded by Italian Ministry of Welfare and developed as an intensive care program for vulnerable families. P.I.P.P.I. is inspired by Pippi-Longstocking, whose life is a particular resilience metaphor, and stands for Program of Intervention for Prevention of Institutionalization. It aims at preventing child placement supporting parenting through a resilience based care process within an ecological perspective participation and multi-professional and intensive-intervention are key. Tools were used with children and parents, in order to give them voice, to collect their points of view on their life situation, and therefore to develop a shared care plan where everyone is a main character of the intervention.
   The main tool is RPMonline, an online-tool developed by University of Padua, that is based on the British Assessment-Framework and it is used for each child to assess, plan and evaluate intervention.
   The first implementation (2011-2012) involved more than 200 practitioners working in 10 Italian cities with 10 vulnerable-families each city (122 children 0-11 years old, 89 families). Data were collected using questionnaires to measure parents' satisfaction, children's behaviour (SDQ), families' social support (MsPSS), and family-functioning (Assessment-Framework). The second implementation (2013-2014), currently in progress in the same cities to consolidate and extend P.I.P.P.I., involves about 500 practitioners and 241 children (166 families). The third implementation has started on January 2014 as the first national scaling up of the program involving 50 cities, 500 families and about 2.500 practitioners.
   The results of first implementation and the available data of the second one will be presented to give evidence to the program and to show how a participatory resilience based practice can foster social work with families and promote their improvement.

AB In a short period of time Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) captured the imagination of many researchers with the number of applications growing rapidly. The applications span large domains including mobile digital health, structural and environmental monitoring, smart home, energy efficient buildings, agriculture, smart cities, etc WSN are also an important contributor to the fast emerging Internet of Things infrastructure. Some of the design specifications for WSN include reliability, accuracy, cost, deployment versatility, power consumption, etc. Power consumption is (most often) the dominant constraint in designing such systems. This constraint has multi-dimensional implications such as battery type and size, energy harvester design, lifetime of the deployment, intelligent sensing capability, etc. Power optimization techniques have to explore a large design search space. Energy neutral system implementation is the ultimate goal in wireless sensor networks ensuring a perpetual/greener use and represents a hot topic of research. Several recent advances promise significant reduction of the overall sensor network power consumption. These advances include novel sensors and sensor interfaces, low energy wireless transceivers, low power processing, efficient energy harvesters, etc. This paper reviews a number of system level power management methodologies for Wireless Sensor Networks. Especially, the paper is focusing on the promising technology of nano Watt wake-up radio receiver and its combination with mature power management techniques to achieve better performance. Some of the presented techniques are then applied in the context of low cost and battery powered toy robots. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB This paper introduces the Semi-Empirical Urban Street (SEUS) model. SEUS is a simple mathematical model based on the scaling of air pollution concentration inside street canyons employing the emission rate, the width of the canyon, the dispersive velocity scale and the background concentration. Dispersive velocity scale depends on turbulent motions related to wind and traffic. The parameterisations of these turbulent motions include two dimensionless empirical parameters. Functional forms of these parameters have been obtained from full scale data measured in street canyons at four European cities. The sensitivity of SEUS model is studied analytically. Results show that relative errors in the evaluation of the two dimensionless empirical parameters have less influence on model uncertainties than uncertainties in other input variables. The model estimates NO2 concentrations using a simple photochemistry scheme. SEUS is applied to estimate NOx and NO2 hourly concentrations in an irregular and busy street canyon in the city of Buenos Aires. The statistical evaluation of results shows that there is a good agreement between estimated and observed hourly concentrations (e.g. fractional bias are -10.3% for NOx and +7.8% for NO2). The agreement between the estimated and observed values has also been analysed in terms of its dependence on wind speed and direction. The model shows a better performance for wind speeds >2 m s(-1) for lower wind speeds and for leeward situations than for others. No significant discrepancies have been found between the results of the proposed model and that of a widely used operational dispersion model (OSPM), both using the same input information.
