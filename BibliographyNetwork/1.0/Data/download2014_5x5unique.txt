AB These proceedings contain the papers presented as oral and poster presentations at the 46th Annual Symposium on Optical Materials for High-Power Lasers. The conference was held at the National Institute of Standards and Technology facility in Boulder, Colorado on 14-17 September 2014. The symposium was divided into the traditional sessions devoted to the following major topics: thin films; surfaces, mirrors and contamination; fundamental mechanisms; materials and measurements. A mini-symposium was held this year on applications related to laser damage. The starting event of the symposium was a tutorial on fundamentals of growth and characterization of amorphous thin films held as a special pre-symposium event on Sunday evening, September 13. The conference was opened by Dr. Detlev Ristau with a symposium welcome. Dr. Gregory J. Exarhos of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (USA), Dr. Vitaly Gruzdev of the University of Missouri, Columbia (USA), Dr. Joseph A. Menapace of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (USA), Dr. Detlev Ristau of the Laser Zentrum Hannover e. V. (Germany), Dr. M. J. Soileau, of the University of Central Florida (USA) co-chaired the symposium. The founding organizers of the symposium are Dr. Arthur H. Guenther and Dr. Alexander J. Glass.
   93 abstracts were submitted to the symposium, of which 81 was presented at 12 oral sessions and 4 poster sessions. No parallel sessions were held allowing the opportunity to discuss common research interests with all the presenters. With 126 participants attending, the meeting offered an outstanding opportunity to make many new acquaintances. Although held annually in the US, Laser Damage symposium continues to be a true international conference with more than 60% of the presentations coming from Europe and Asia. As usual, the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, offered a setting conductive to effective communication and interchange between individuals working in closely related and complementary fields. We look forward to future opportunities to come together again in this setting.
   The 47th Annual Symposium of this series will be held in Boulder, Colorado, 27-30 September 2015. A continuous effort will be made to ensure a close liaison between the high-energy, high-peak-power, and high-average-power laser communities, as well as to include damage issues related to various research efforts and commercial laser applications. A mini-symposium focused on multilayer dielectric mirrors for ultrafast lasers is anticipated. Invited talks are also anticipated to open the four major topical areas and the mini-symposium. Following much feedback from symposium participants, relocation of the symposium beginning in 2016 is under active discussion. Several cities in Europe, US, and Asia and re-location regimes (annual or bi-annual) are under consideration now.
   The principal topics to be considered as contributed papers in 2015 do not differ drastically from those enumerated above. We expect to hear more about the impact of contamination on the laser resistance of optical components and the influence of defects since both those topics continue to generate significant interest. High-energy laser windows, crystals, and transparent ceramics continue to place limitations on laser systems so remain an active area of research and spirited debate. Refinement of the mitigation strategy consisting of damage initiation followed by arresting damage growth through post-processing techniques while not creating downstream damage is also expected to be a continued focus as a large number of laser-resistant UV optics are manufactured for laser-lithography applications. Short pulse (nanosecond and picosecond) laser optics and damage phenomena remain an active area of research. Recent progress in the fields of ultrashort-pulse (femtosecond) lasers and ultrafast laser-material interactions is believed to be one of the fastest growing area of the future symposium. We also expect to hear more about new measurement techniques to improve our understanding of the different damage mechanisms or to improve the manufacturing of optical materials and thin films for optical components of greater laser damage resistance. Thin films for a broad range of laser wavelengths and pulse durations will continue to stay one of hot topics of the symposium. Also, new developments in the field of metamaterials and related laser-damage issues will attract growing attention due to their intensive development and potential use in high-power lasers. Fundamental aspects of laser-induced damage including multiphoton and avalanche ionization, scaling of damage threshold with laser and material parameters continuously attract a lot of attention. More presentations on lifetime and optics aging are expected in 2015 due to the significance of those issues for industrial and energy applications of high-power lasers.
   As was initially established in 1992, several distinguished invited speakers will deliver keynote presentations of a tutorial or review nature, in addition, other contributors will cover late-breaking developments. Another tutorial is also expected to be delivered as a pre-symposium event on Sunday evening.
   The purpose of this series of symposia is to provide an international platform for information exchange about optical materials for high-power /high-energy lasers and a broad range of topics related to laser-induced damage in those materials. The editors welcome comments and criticism from all interested readers relevant to this purpose.

AB Background: Scaling up innovative healthcare programs offers a means to improve access, quality, and health equity across multiple health areas. Despite large numbers of promising projects, little is known about successful efforts to scale up. This study examines trans-national scale, whereby a program operates in two or more countries. Trans-national scale is a distinct measure that reflects opportunities to replicate healthcare programs in multiple countries, thereby providing services to broader populations.
   Methods: Based on the Center for Health Market Innovations (CHMI) database of nearly 1200 health programs, the study contrasts 116 programs that have achieved trans-national scale with 1,068 single-country programs. Data was collected on the programs' health focus, service activity, legal status, and funding sources, as well as the programs' locations (rural v. urban emphasis), and founding year; differences are reported with statistical significance.
   Findings: This analysis examines 116 programs that have achieved trans-national scale (TNS) across multiple disease areas and activity types. Compared to 1,068 single-country programs, we find that trans-nationally scaled programs are more donor-reliant; more likely to focus on targeted health needs such as HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, or family planning rather than provide more comprehensive general care; and more likely to engage in activities that support healthcare services rather than provide direct clinical care.
   Conclusion: This work, based on a large data set of health programs, reports on trans-national scale with comparison to single-country programs. The work is a step towards understanding when programs are able to replicate their services as they attempt to expand health services for the poor across countries and health areas. A subset of these programs should be the subject of case studies to understand factors that affect the scaling process, particularly seeking to identify mechanisms that lead to improved health outcomes.

AB In assessing the concentrations of bioaerosols around facilities the ambient background concentrations play a major role. There is increasing knowledge on background concentrations of different bioaerosol measuring parameters, but obtained with a variety of measuring methods. It has been shown previously that background concentrations of mould fungi follow a log-normal distribution. Here this analysis was done for concentrations of ambient bacteria using a data set of urban background measurements of bacteria which included concentration data of mould fungi. Comparison of different measuring methods was performed by analyzing a further data set of mould fungi concentrations obtained at one background measuring site simultaneously with two different methods. For all bioaerosol measuring parameters it could be demonstrated that median is more appropriate than arithmetic mean in order to describe the measure of central tendency of the concentration distribution. Median for total bacteria was 150 cfu/m(3), the 90th percentile value relevant for assessment according to VDI 4250 sheet 1 was 720 cfu/m(3). Scaling of the different measuring methods reveals that for a certain measuring situation the percentile values - set as assessment relevant background values - independently of the measuring method lie by the same factor above the median, thus allowing a consistent procedure-independent assessment of bioaerosols.

AB The morphology of street patterns has been the subject of many studies in recent decades. While some have noted the textural and morphological differences in various parts of many cities, there have been few attempts to quantify the street patterns that contribute to these differences. For this study, we measured and compared the trends (orientations) and lengths of 4,266 streets in the old, historical part of the city of Yazd, Iran, and 4,021 streets in the new part of the city to quantify their textural (morphological) differences and similarities. In the old part of the city, the street trends are orthogonal and follow a normal (one-peak) distribution. The street lengths range from 4-317 m, follow power-law distributions, and yield street-population entropies of 1.360-1.565. The power-law distributions indicate that, in the old part of Yazd, there are many short streets and few long ones. By contrast, in the new part of the city, the street trends follow a bimodal (two-peak) distribution. The street lengths vary from 5-596 m, follow power-law distributions, and yield entropies of 1.632-2.290. All of the street populations show strong linear correlations between their scaling exponents, length ranges, and entropies, a finding that agrees with results from other cities. With regard to city planning, these correlations indicate that, as a city grows and expands, its street networks often increase in length and entropy, requiring greater energy for construction. The innovative quantitative approach used to analyze city textures in this paper can also be used to compare the sizes and shapes of buildings within and among cities.
