AB In previous work from this laboratory, it has been found that the urban heat island intensity (UHI) can be scaled with the urban length scale and the wind speed, through the time-dependent energy balance. The heating of the urban surfaces during the daytime sets the initial temperature, and this overheating is dissipated during the night-time through mean convection motion over the urban surface. This may appear to be in contrast to the classical work by Oke (1973). However, in this work, we show that if the population density is used in converting the population data into urbanized area, then a good agreement with the current theory is found. An additional parameter is the "urban flow parameter," which depends on the urban building characteristics and affects the horizontal convection of heat due to wind. This scaling can be used to estimate the UHI intensity in any cities and therefore predict the required energy consumption during summer months. In addition, all urbanized surfaces are expected to exhibit this scaling, so that increase in the surface temperature in large energy-consumption or energy-producing facilities (e. g., solar electric or thermal power plants) can be estimated.

TI Scaling properties of urban facilities
SO PHYSICAL REVIEW E

DT Article
ID GROWTH PATTERNS; CITIES
AB Two measurements are employed to quantitatively investigate the scaling properties of the spatial distribution of urban facilities: the K function [whose derivative gives the radial distribution function rho(t) = K'(t)/2 pi t] by number counting and the variance-mean relationship by the method of expanding bins. The K function and the variance-mean relationship are both power functions. This means that the spatial distributions of urban facilities are scaling invariant. Further analysis of more data (which includes eight types of facilities in 37 major Chinese cities) shows that the the power laws broadly hold for all combinations of facilities and cities. A double stochastic process (DSP) model is proposed as a mathematical mechanism by which spatial point patterns can be generated that resemble the actual distribution of urban facilities both qualitatively and quantitatively. Simulation of the DSP yields a better agreement with the urban data than the correlated percolation model.

AB The increasing population in Surabaya has expanded the city's areas until its suburbs. In 2000, 2.4 million people lived in the city and this population dramatically increases to be more than 3 million in 2011. The main problem comes from the central activities for the communities which have been centralized in the city center while people move to live outside the city. Commuters with long distances indicated by travel volumes which are bigger in the streets which connect the city center to its suburbs comparing to the streets which connect nodes inside the city have shown the non-resilient city planning which disregards environmental issues. In 2005, the transportation sector already produced 5,480,000 ton of carbon dioxides and contributed 96% from all total emissions in Surabaya.
   One of the sustainable urban planning concepts which can be adopted to boost the resilience of the Surabaya city is the compact city concept. This concept has been viewed as the solution of the urban sprawl and its derived problems. However, research are needed before implementing this concept in Surabaya because every city has its own characteristics and there is a possibility that Surabaya will have different influences for this concept in reducing its transportation problems.
   In this paper, the impact of urban compactness in transportation in Surabaya city will be explained. Furthermore, the strategies which can be applied to increase the effect of the compact city concept in transportation will be also described. In order to do so, this paper is divided into three parts. In the first part, the multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to measure the urban compactness in Surabaya. There were twelve variables used in this first part which are population density, build up density, residential density, availability of elementary, junior, and senior high school, medical facilities and services, working and recreational areas, and population growth rate and migration rate. Based on these variables, Simokerto, Tandes and Dukuh Pakis were chosen as the representative of compact, middle, and sprawl areas respectively. In these three representative areas, surveys were conducted to identify the effectiveness of compact city in creating resilience city and transportation system. In the compact area, the transportation system already shows sustainable patterns with less motorized and more walking and public transit uses while in the middle and sprawl areas the urban compactness level still have to be increased. In the last part of analysis, triangulation method was used and resulted that in compact area, the urban compactness level needs to be maintained with possible combination with transit oriented development and public transport priority strategies. In the other side, middle and sprawl areas need to increase their compactness level through increasing in density and mixed use points to achieve the resilience city and transportation system.

AB During the last decade significant efforts have been made to monitor cities and record their current situation and growth through time. Advances in aerial photography and the implementation of ortho-images enabled the cartography of large scale areas leading to numerous applications in data recording in both rural and urban regions. Features extraction from such images poses a challenging goal especially in areas exhibiting little chromatic variations, such as multiple detached cement buildings surrounded by cement pavements and tar roads, and dynamic noise conditions due to large building shades and moving vehicles. This paper presents a fully automated software solution for the identification of compact buildings-blocks from aerial ortho-photographs. The aim is to identify and record compact building-blocks' perimeters ignoring any lesser features displayed by them in order to produce a set of planar coordinates for every building-block. This information is most valuable for topographical city mapping applications and can be further exploited towards city-modeling either by stereo-photography or laser scanning technology, and necessary scaling and alignment techniques to import the height information in an expanded spatial set of coordinates.

AB The scaling exponent of a hierarchy of cities used to be regarded as a fractional dimension. The Pareto exponent was treated as the fractal dimension of size distribution of cities, while the Zipf exponent was considered to be the reciprocal of the fractal dimension. However, this viewpoint is not exact. In this paper, I will present a new interpretation of the scaling exponent of rank-size distributions. The ideas from fractal measure relation and the principle of dimension consistency are employed to explore the essence of Pareto's and Zipf's scaling exponents. The Pareto exponent proved to be a ratio of the fractal dimension of a network of cities to the average dimension of city population. Accordingly, the Zipf exponent is the reciprocal of this dimension ratio. On a digital map, the Pareto exponent can be defined by the scaling relation between a map scale and the corresponding number of cities based on this scale. The cities of the United States of America in 1900, 1940, 1960, and 1980 and Indian cities in 1981, 1991, and 2001 are utilized to illustrate the geographical spatial meaning of Pareto's exponent. The results suggest that the Pareto exponent of city-size distributions is a dimension ratio rather than a fractal dimension itself. This conclusion is revealing for scientists to understand Zipf's law on the rank-size pattern and the fractal structure of hierarchies of cities.
