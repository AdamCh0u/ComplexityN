AB China has achieved rapid urbanization and unprecedented economic booming over the past three decades. Numerous cities and towns dreamed of cloning the miracles of Shenzhen and Pudong, Shanghai, in terms of their international development. However, inappropriate development strategies have meant that the majority of fast expanding urban suburbs or newly developed towns suffer a high ratio of vacant dwellings in real estate markets and a massive loss of farmland. The frequent exposure of these empty cities to mass media or the public has urged urban governments to impose fiscal austerity. These unexpected and negative consequences of urban development have explicit conflicts with sustainability. This paper aims to provide a political economy view of these unsustainable outcomes of new development. To achieve this, the processes and agendas of new city or town planning in Wujin District, Changzhou City, are analyzed and evaluated from the perspective of scale theory. Extensive interviews conducted with local politicians at different levels, planners, real estate agents and local residents facilitate the interpretation of these processes and agendas. It is argued that the legends of Shenzhen and Pudong, Shanghai originate from a modified neoliberal capitalism intervention at the right time and place, with which other peer cities are not comparable. It is concluded that the scaling-up strategy is not appropriate for the local new town development of Wujin, which has led to unsustainable outcomesempty cities and townsand created important lessons for the sustainable development of Chinese cities.

ID MORTALITY
AB Maternal mortality has been reduced by half from 1990 to 2010, yet a woman in sub-Saharan Africa has a lifetime risk of maternal death of 1 in 39 compared with around 1 in 10,000 in industrialized countries. Annual rates of reduction of maternal mortality of over 10% have been achieved in several countries. Highly cost-effective interventions exist and are being scaled up, such as family planning, emergency obstetric and newborn care, quality service delivery, midwifery, maternal death surveillance and response, and girls' education; however, coverage still remains low. Maternal mortality reduction is now high on the global agenda. We examined scenarios of reduction of maternal mortality by 2035. Ending preventable maternal deaths could be achieved in nearly all countries by 2035 with challenging yet realistic efforts: (1) massive scaling-up and skilling up of human resources for family planning and maternal health; (2) reaching every village in every district and every urban slum toward universal health coverage; (3) enhanced financing; (4) knowledge for action: enhanced monitoring, accountability, evaluation, and R&D.

ID SYSTEMS
AB This paper presents the system architecture of an event-based building management platform. By incorporating the distributed computing technologies in its core, it is able to adaptively scale horizontally without the redesign and the configuration downtime. The commodity hardware and networks used, permit vertical scaling if performance requirements change after the deployment. Additionally, the proposed solution offers an abstraction layer to the management components and the construction framework. This layer is built on modern web technologies facilitating the creation of innovating user driver applications and demand side management coordinators that are universal across the various building structures. Eventually this unification of the high performance management systems and the modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) shall catalyze the integration of smart buildings in the future smart cities.

AB This paper describes how the Urban Reproductive Health Initiative in Kenya, the Tupange Project (2010-2015), successfully applied the ExpandNet approach to sustainably scale up family planning interventions, first in Machakos and Kakamega, and subsequently also in its three core cities, Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa. This new focus meant shifting from a "project" to a "program" approach, which required paying attention to government leadership and ownership, limiting external inputs, institutionalizing interventions in existing structures and emphasizing sustainability. The paper also highlights the project's efforts to prepare for the future scale up of Tupange's interventions in other counties to support continuing and improved access to family planning services in the new context of devolution (decentralization) in Kenya.

FU Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)
FX The authors would like to thank the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
   (BMGF) for funding the Tupange Project and for their flexibility in
   allowing Tupange to explore and learn about new approaches. Clea Finkle
   at BMGF reviewed and provided valuable input to the draft manuscript.
   The authors gratefully acknowledge the productive collaboration with the
   Ministry of Health's Division of Family Health, Reproductive and
   Maternal Health Services Unit (formerly the Division of Reproductive
   Health), especially Maina Jonah, as well as national and the county
   governments of Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Kakamega and Machakos and
   private sector colleagues who participated in testing, reviewing and
   implementing Tupange-supported interventions. Without their interest and
   enthusiasm to work towards improving access to quality family planning
   services, the authors would not have been able to contribute toward the
   learning about scaling up described here. The support of Isaac Malonzo,
   the Kenya Country Director of Jhpiego, was essential in allowing Tupange
   to pursue its unconventional path. While not all members of the Tupange
   team could be authors of this paper, they all contributed in major ways
   to the successes described here. Finally we also wish to acknowledge the
   Measurement, Learning and Evaluation (MLE) Project for providing data on
   baseline, midline and endline Tupange evaluations.

AB The creative industries are gaining recognition among countries of the EU, where the regional policy plays a key role in the economic development. However, the relationship between the EU Structural funds and the creative industries is limited specifically to culture, while the concept itself has not been assessed yet. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of the Structural funds in the creative industries for the programming period 2007-2013. Regression unstandardized residuals were depicted by choropleth maps and multidimensional scaling for spatial analysis of the largest cities by population in the Czech Republic. The findings proved that dominant use of the Structural funds is in the culture sector, while the cultural and creative industries were not specifically supported. Moreover, particular differences were identified in spatial distribution of the creative industries. The results provide a methodological basis for evaluation and further research in conjunction with changing objectives and themes of support from the EU Structural funds in upcoming programming period. Particular focus is put on increasing the proportion of support towards the creative industries and awareness of policy-makers in reduction of spatial disparities in the use of public funds.
