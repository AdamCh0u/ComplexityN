ID EARTHQUAKES
AB The response of any physical system is nonlinear unless the magnitude of the input is very small. The M-w magnitudes of deep Vrancea earthquakes are between 0.02 and 7.9. The leading question is: how many cities, villages, metropolitan areas etc. in seismic regions are constructed on rock sites? Most of them are located on alluvial deposits, on Quaternary layers or in river valleys. A soil is of basic type sand or gravel (termed coarse soils), silt or clay (termed fine soils) etc. Strong ground accelerations from large and deep Vrancea earthquakes can produce a non-linear response in shallow soils and the shaking from large earthquakes cannot be predicted by simple scaling of records from small earthquakes [12]. The question: is that real and how much? Laboratory tests indicate that as the strain increases above 10(-4) %, damping (absorption) increases and the shear modulus (rigidity) decreases. This should results in two observable effects as the level of ground motion at a soil site increases; a decrease in amplification due to the increase in damping and a lowering of the site response frequency as the shear modulus decreases. The novelty and the complexity degree comes from the fact that for first time, the final decision for NPP Cemavoda site, in 2012, was also based on local strong nonlinear spectral amplifications for strong earthquakes and used in last "STRESS TEST" asked by IAEA Vienna in 2011. The present analysis indicates that the effects of soil nonlinearity could be very important in seismology, in seismic hazard analyses and earthquake engineering. The authors are coming with many recorded data which will open up a new challenge for seismologists studying nonlinear site effects in 2-D and 3-D irregular geological structures, leading them to a realistic research subject in earth physics, in nonlinear seismology [1].

AB We generalized the recently introduced "radiation model", as an analog to the generalization of the classic "gravity model", to consolidate its nature of universality for modeling diverse mobility systems. By imposing the appropriate scaling exponent., normalization factor. and system constraints including searching direction and trip OD constraint, the generalized radiation model accurately captures real human movements in various scenarios and spatial scales, including two different countries and four different cities. Our analytical results also indicated that the generalized radiation model outperformed alternative mobility models in various empirical analyses.

AB Urban areas are expanding, changing the structure and productivity of landscapes. While some urban areas have been shown to hold substantial biomass, the productivity of these systems is largely unknown. We assessed how conversion from forest to urban land uses affected both biomass structure and productivity across eastern Massachusetts. We found that urban land uses held less than half the biomass of adjacent forest expanses with a plot level mean biomass density of 33.5 +/- 8.0 Mg C ha(-1). As the intensity of urban development increased, the canopy cover, stem density, and biomass decreased. Analysis of Quercus rubra tree cores showed that tree-level basal area increment nearly doubled following development, increasing from 17.1 +/- 3.0 to 35.8 +/- 4.7 cm(2) yr(-1). Scaling the observed stem densities and growth rates within developed areas suggests an aboveground biomass growth rate of 1.8 +/- 0.4 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1), a growth rate comparable to nearby, intact forests. The contrasting high growth rates and lower biomass pools within urban areas suggest a highly dynamic ecosystem with rapid turnover. As global urban extent continues to grow, cities consider climate mitigation options, and as the verification of net greenhouse gas emissions emerges as critical for policy, quantifying the role of urban vegetation in regional-to-global carbon budgets will become ever more important.

AB Background: Urban malaria is now considered a major emerging health problem in Africa and urban insecticide resistance may represent a serious threat to the ambitious programme of further scaling-up coverage with long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor residual spray. This study evaluates the levels and mechanisms of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae populations in 44 urban areas of Dakar in a longitudinal entomological surveillance study.
   Methods: Adult mosquitoes sampled by night-landing catches at 44 sites across Dakar from 2007 to 2010 were genotyped to assess the frequency and distribution of resistance alleles. In addition World Health Organization susceptibility tests to six insecticides were performed on F0 adults issuing from immature stages of An. gambiae s.l. sampled in August 2010, 2011 and 2012 in three sites of Dakar: Pikine, Thiaroye and Almadies and repeated in 2012 with three of the insecticides after PBO exposure to test for mechanisms of oxydase resistance. Species, molecular forms and the presence of kdr and ace-1 mutations were assessed by polymerase chain reaction.
   Results: High frequencies of the kdr-e allele, ranging from 35 to 100 %, were found in Anopheles arabiensis at all 44 sites. The insecticide susceptibility tests indicated sensitivity to bendiocarb in Almadies in 2010 and 2011 and in Yarakh between 2010 and 2012 and sensitivity to fenitrothion in Almadies in 2010. The mortality rate of EE genotype mosquitoes was lower and that of SS mosquitoes was higher than that of SE mosquitoes, while the mortality rate of the SW genotype was slightly higher than that of the SE genotype. Pyperonyl butoxide (PBO) had a significant effect on mortality in Pikine (OR = 1.4, 95 % CI = 1.3-1.5, with mortality of 42-55 % after exposure and 11-17 % without PBO) and Yarakh (OR = 1.6, 95 % CI = 1.4-1.7, with mortality of 68-81 % after exposure and 23-37 % without), but not in Almadies (OR = 1.0, 95 % CI = 0.9-1.1).
   Conclusion: A high prevalence of kdr-e in West Africa was demonstrated, and knock-down resistance mechanisms predominate although some oxidases mechanisms (cytochrome P450 monooxygenases) also occur. In view of the increased use of insecticides and the proposed role of the kdr gene in the susceptibility of Anopheles to Plasmodium, this finding will significantly affect the success of vector control programmes.

TI Optimal Total Planning for Incinerator Plants in an Urban Area

AB This paper proposes optimal total planning for incinerator plants (IPs) in a typical urban area, which includes a method of determining the number of plants and the capacities of the IPs. Burnable municipal refuse is disposed of sanitarily by high-temperature incineration at the IPs. At the same time, power generation from waste (PGW) is being performed at many IPs to recover energy. At present, the amount of energy generated by PGW is greater than that of wind power or photovoltaic power generation. However, PGW has a limited generation efficiency and low generation output due to the smaller capacity of IPs. To overcome the above weakness, highly efficient PGW is necessary with total integration and scaling up of IPs. Regarding total integration and scaling up, operation in larger areas is favorable from the point of view of refuse volume and collection. In the planning stage, both the cost of IPs and refuse collection, which is important for refuse disposal, should be taken into account comprehensively. Optimal total planing for IPs can be performed in two stages. First, the disposal capacity G(k) of an IP versus the number of plants K is decided by constraints. G(k) is about the same for all K because of maintenance and refuse collection, and is greater than 300 tons per day in steps of 100 tons per day. G(k) should be decided not only by refuse volume but also by cessation of operation at plants due to maintenance or faults. Second, the cost of each value of K is calculated based on the construction and operating costs of the IPs, income from selling the energy of PGW, and refuse collection costs. Therefore, the value of K with the minimum cost is selected as the optimal number of IPs. A numerical simulation of an area with a population of 3 million indicates that the optimal plant number is 4. At present there are eight or nine IPs in cities of 3 million people. The above cost reduction effect will be about 15% from the present value. Considering the situation of aging IPs, a decreasing trend in refuse volume, and the stringent financial conditions of local governments, the proposed method is very effective and realistic.
