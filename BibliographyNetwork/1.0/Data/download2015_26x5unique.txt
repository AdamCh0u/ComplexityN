AB Block processing algorithms have great potential in GNSS receivers. The block processing methods considered here are based on the Fourier correlation method which generates the full correlation function. Historically the large processing power requirements of FFT have prevented these block processing methods being used outside the acquisition phase. This paper presents an algorithm which reduces the processing requirements of FFT-based block processing for GNSS signals by an order of magnitude compared to current techniques.
   The Multiple Tracking Locked Loop (MTLL) FFT algorithm presented here in the limit of long integration times (circa 20ms or longer) and multiple tracked satellites (circa 10) scales near-linearly with sample rate. The MTLL method can be applied to GPS and Galileo signals and still exhibits its near-linear scaling with either signal constellation.
   As the MTLL algorithm gives access to the full correlation function further post processing can be done to completely mitigate multipath, where there is line of sight to the satellite and its ability to remove multipath effects is only limited by the initial RF sampling bandwidth. The MTLL method also lends itself to the detection and mitigation of interference as it is based on performing FFTs.
   The method lends itself to long integration times and can be easily implemented on standard computer hardware. This allows very high sensitive receivers that operate in difficult conditions like indoors, urban environments and under fading due to scintillation.
   This paper defines the algorithm and the underlying principles, describes how the tracking algorithm works and how it has been implemented in a software receiver using standard commercial computer hardware. Early results of experiments done using GPS and Galileo constellations are also presented.

TI Pretreatment HIV-1 drug resistance to first-line drugs: results from a

AB Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and correlates of pretreatment drug resistance (PDR) to first-line antiretroviral drugs among people initiating therapy for HIV in Vietnam.
   Methods: Blood was collected during November 2009 to October 2010 from people consecutively initiating ART in four purposively selected public outpatient clinics in three Vietnamese cities. At each study site, recruitment lasted for 6-10 months until the target sample size (range 120-130 individuals) had been reached. The viral load was measured in 501 samples; 490 samples (viral load >= 1000 copies/mL) were genotyped using a nucleotide population-based sequencing assay. Self-reported demographic and clinical data were elicited through interviews. We classified drug-resistance-associated mutations (DRMs) according to the 2009 WHO surveillance list.
   Results: DRMs were identified in 17/490 participants (3.5%; 95% CI 2.2%-5.5%). The prevalence of DRMs was 1.6% (8/490) against NRTIs, 1.6% (8/490) against NNRTIs and 0.8% (4/490) against PIs; three (0.6%) participants were resistant to both NRTIs and NNRTIs. The overall prevalence of PDR to first-line drugs was low[2.7% (13/490); 95% CI 1.6%-4.4%]. The prevalence of PDR to first-line drugs was greater among 198 HIV-infected participants who injected drugs than among 286 participants who reported risks for sexually acquired HIV (4.0% versus 1.4%, P = 0.079). Multivariable logistic regression analysis suggested that PDR to first-line drugs was significantly higher among people who injected drugs (OR = 3.94; 95% CI 1.13-13.68).
   Conclusions: With low PDR, first-line ART may be effective in Vietnam and pretreatment genotyping may be unnecessary. Continuing strategies for the prevention and surveillance of antiretroviral resistance are important for maintaining a low prevalence of antiretroviral resistance in Vietnam. The association between resistance and injection drug use warrants further research.

DE Cellular offloading; mobile demand; open Wi-Fi; measurement data
AB Wi-Fi offloading is one of the most effective approaches to relieve the cellular radio access from part of the burgeoning mobile demand. To date, Wi-Fi offloading has been mainly leveraged in limited contexts, such as home, office or campus environments. In this paper, we investigate the scaling properties of Wi-Fi offloading, by studying how it would perform on a much larger scope than those considered today. To that end, we consider a real-world citywide scenario, built on data about actual infrastructure deployments and mobile traffic demand, and observe which amount of traffic could be accommodated by the existing pervasive Wi-Fi access infrastructure, were it opened to mobile users. We find that more than 80% of the mobile traffic demand in a large urban area may be easily served by Wi-Fi access points, under a wide range of system settings.

AB To respond to the dynamics of urban surroundings, enhancing innovativeness in the urban environment has become increasingly important. The major challenge with innovations in urban environment is that many of them do not diffuse easily. The paper identifies the challenges related to urban innovation processes and their scaling-up, using the renewable energy solution pilot project as an example case. This is done by discussing the position and maturity of Renewable Energy Solutions in City Areas (RESCA) in an innovation typology context, and by assessing performed actions aimed at boosting the innovativeness in the case project. Results emphasized the essential role of the local building administration as a proactive stakeholder who started open-mindedly to address old-fashioned, inefficient and dominant practices of the construction industry. Another innovation hot-spot was that market actors needed to collaborate, take steps and present their ideas in order to find, implement and pilot the emerging solutions and innovations.

DE Affordable shelter; Egypt; Housing policy; Informal settlements;
   Upgrading strategies; Urban poor
AB The issue of informal settlements represents a key challenge not only in Egypt, but also worldwide. A review of informal settlements upgrading policies shows that governments have moved away from eradication policies to provision, enabling and participatory policies. This shift was motivated by the recognition that informal settlements were not a problem but a solution stimulated by the society when the formal housing markets cannot fulfill its demand. In Egypt, despite all efforts to contain the growth of informal settlements, they are steadily growing. This paper aims at mapping the change of informal settlements upgrading strategies in Egypt starting from negligence to contemporary participatory development approaches and housing policies aimed at providing affordable shelter to the urban poor. Additionally, it examines some best practices of informal settlements upgrading projects to find out the influential driving forces affecting the success of these projects that are suitable for scaling up and replication.
