AB Scaling of direct potable water reuse (DPR) systems involves tradeoffs of treatment facility economy-of-scale, versus cost and energy of conveyance including energy for upgradient distribution of treated water, and retention of wastewater thermal energy. In this study, a generalized model of the cost of DPR as a function of treatment plant scale, assuming futuristic, optimized conveyance networks, was constructed for purposes of developing design principles. Fractal landscapes representing flat, hilly, and mountainous topographies were simulated, with urban, suburban, and rural housing distributions placed by modified preferential growth algorithm. Treatment plants were allocated by agglomerative hierarchical clustering, networked to buildings by minimum spanning tree. Simulations assume advanced oxidation-based DPR system design, with 20-year design life and capability to mineralize chemical oxygen demand below normal detection limits, allowing implementation in regions where disposal of concentrate containing hormones and anti-scalants is not practical. Results indicate that total DPR capital and O&M costs in rural areas, where systems that return nutrients to the land may be more appropriate, are high. However, costs in urban/suburban areas are competitive with current water/wastewater service costs at scales of ca. one plant per 10,000 residences. This size is relatively small, and costs do not increase significantly until plant service areas fall below 100 to 1000 homes. Based on these results, distributed DPR systems are recommended for consideration for urban/suburban water and wastewater system capacity expansion projects. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide additional insight into how the level of subjective knowledge (SK) related to wine explains differences in the wine-consumption behaviour of young adults. Particular attention was given to information search strategies employed by young adult wine consumers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A web-based survey was carried out on 287 young urban wine consumers who were recruited in specialised wine shops and at wine festivals. The key variables presenting the consumers' wine searches were measured using the best-worst scaling method. Latent class cluster analysis (LCA) was used to segment the respondents into clusters based on their level of SK of wine.
   Findings - The study identifies three consumer segments with corresponding levels of SK related to wine. The segments present considerable differences in the wine-consumption-related behaviours and information search strategies.
   Research limitations/implications - Understanding young adults' SK of wine will assist wine marketers in their efforts to establish marketing strategies for this generational cohort. In addition, research (preferably transnational) is recommended to validate the conclusions and to gain additional understanding of SK as an indicator of wine-related behaviours.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to a better understanding of the wine-purchasing behaviours of young adults with particular focus on SK related to wine. The results obtained may be applied by winemakers in the development of marketing and promotion strategies geared towards the promising young adult consumer segment.

AB Urbanization promotes economy, mobility, access, and availability of resources, but on the other hand, generates higher levels of pollution, violence, crime, and mental distress. The health consequences of the agglomeration of people living close together are not fully understood. Particularly, it remains unclear how variations in the population size across cities impact the health of the population. We analyze the deviations from linearity of the scaling of several health-related quantities, such as the incidence and mortality of diseases, external causes of death, wellbeing, and health care availability, in respect to the population size of cities in Brazil, Sweden, and the USA. We find that deaths by non-communicable diseases tend to be relatively less common in larger cities, whereas the per capita incidence of infectious diseases is relatively larger for increasing population size. Healthier lifestyle and availability of medical support are disproportionally higher in larger cities. The results are connected with the optimization of human and physical resources and with the non-linear effects of social networks in larger populations. An urban advantage in terms of health is not evident, and using rates as indicators to compare cities with different population sizes may be insufficient.

TI Prioritizing action on health inequities in cities: An evaluation of
   Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (Urban HEART) in 15
   cities from Asia and Africa

AB Following the recommendations of the Commission on Social Determinants of Health (2008), the World Health Organization (WHO) developed the Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool (HEART) to support local stakeholders in identifying and planning action on health inequities. The objective of this report is to analyze the experiences of cities in implementing Urban HEART in order to inform how the future development of the tool could support local stakeholders better in addressing health inequities.
   The study method is documentary analysis from independent evaluations and city implementation reports submitted to WHO. Independent evaluations were conducted in 2011-12 on Urban HEART piloting in 15 cities from seven countries in Asia and Africa: Indonesia, Iran, Kenya, Mongolia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam.
   Local or national health departments led Urban HEART piloting in 12 of the 15 cities. Other stakeholders commonly engaged included the city council, budget and planning departments, education sector, urban planning department, and the Mayor's office. Ten of the 12 core indicators recommended in Urban HEART were collected by at least 10 of the 15 cities. Improving access to safe water and sanitation was a priority equity-oriented intervention in 12 of the 15 cities, while unemployment was addressed in seven cities.
   Cities who piloted Urban HEART displayed confidence in its potential by sustaining or scaling up its use within their countries. Engagement of a wider group of stakeholders was more likely to lead to actions for improving health equity. Indicators that were collected were more likely to be acted upon. Quality of data for neighbourhoods within cities was one of the major issues.
   As local governments and stakeholders around the world gain greater control of decisions regarding their health, Urban HEART could prove to be a valuable tool in helping them pursue the goal of health equity.

AB Sweetpotato is widely grown in almost all agroecological zones of Rwanda, where it is prized by most resource-poor farmers as a reliable, low-input, food security crop but with limited commercial potential. The bulkiness, lack of processing technologies and lack of market at the peak of sweetpotato production are reported as major constraints by producers and policy makers for scaling up production. A strategy to promote and make available to farmers disease-free planting material of two elite selected orange-fleshed sweetpotato varieties (Gihingamukungu and Cacearpedo) that yield roots of acceptable consumer quality was initiated and has been adopted by organized farmers' groups in three districts. Processing sweetpotato into products offers the opportunity to increase demand for the crop and create added value. Since 2010, the Rwanda Sweetpotato Super Foods action research project, a collaboration between different stakeholders has been investigating how to connect smallholder sweetpotato producers to agro-processors through effective value chains. Tasty and acceptable sweetpotato products have been developed, processed and promoted among different rural, semi-urban and urban consumers. Farmers in different groups and individual contracted farmers are producing and selling fresh roots. Akarabo Golden Power Biscuits and Mandazi doughnuts are two sweetpotato-based processed products profitably produced and marketed by Urubwitso (SINA) Enterprises.
