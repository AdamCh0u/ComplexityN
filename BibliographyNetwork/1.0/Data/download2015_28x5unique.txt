AB Previous studies show that the center of a geographic space is of great importance in urban and regional studies, including study of population distribution, urban growth modeling, and scaling properties of urban systems, etc. But how to well define and how to efficiently extract the center of a geographic space are still largely unknown. Recently, Jiang et al. have presented a definition of topological center by their block detection (BD) algorithm. Despite the fact that they first introduced the definition and discovered the 'true center', in human minds, their algorithm left several redundancies in its traversal process. Here, we propose an alternative road-cycle detection (RCD) algorithm to find the topological center, which extracts the outmost road-cycle recursively. To foster the application of the topological center in related research fields, we first reproduce the BD algorithm in Python (pyBD), then implement the RCD algorithm in two ways: the ArcPy implementation (arcRCD) and the Python implementation (pyRCD). After the experiments on twenty-four typical road networks, we find that the results of our RCD algorithm are consistent with those of Jiang's BD algorithm. We also find that the RCD algorithm is at least seven times more efficient than the BD algorithm on all the ten typical road networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

ID ADAPTATION STRATEGIES
AB The consequences of high-end climate scenarios and the risks of extreme events involve a number of critical assumptions and methodological challenges related to key uncertainties in climate scenarios and modelling, impact analysis, and economics. A methodological framework for integrated analysis of extreme events and damage costs is developed and applied to a case study of urban flooding for the medium sized Danish city of Odense. Moving from our current climate to higher atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations including a 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and a high-end 6 degrees C scenario implies that the frequency of extreme events increase beyond scaling, and in combination with economic assumptions we find a very wide range of risk estimates for urban precipitation events. A sensitivity analysis addresses 32 combinations of climate scenarios, damage cost curve approaches, and economic assumptions, including risk aversion and equity represented by discount rates. Major impacts of alternative assumptions are investigated. As a result, this study demonstrates that in terms of decision making the actual expectations concerning future climate scenarios and the economic assumptions applied are very important in determining the risks of extreme climate events and, thereby, of the level of cost-effective adaptation seen from the society's point of view.

DE workshop; education; design strategy; design tools; cognitive theory;
   learning; making sharing; creative communities
AB In this paper I would like to describe the potentialities of the workshop (ws) format in design education - thanks to experiences I attended both as teaching assistant and as participant - in order to gather:
   Key features of this kind of practices
   Psychological (inner and environmental) aspects that increase the results' level
   Adjustment of usual teaching methodologies Increase of tutoring capacities
   The goal is to support this approach, especially in design education and practice.
   One of the fundamental component of education is time: have time to learn means have time to let information be received, understood and, finally, learned. The last means that this information is not only memorized, but is also knowledge ready to be used. Each notion follow this linear path and crosses a multitude of others where categorizations, comparisons and value scaling composed everyone knowledge.
   [Graphics]
   What happens in design schools, where students are asked to acquire information and to made project at the same time? More then other courses, design education is not linear in the passage from "learning" to "doing" (practicing) but stays in constant balance between acquirements and practices. Furthermore, learning and doing phases related to a specific notion do not run their binary simultaneously: very often occurred that a project asked to be aware of an aspect (i.e. how a specific material can be used) before that notion has been received and, vice versa, a notion is acquired when there is no awareness of how it can be employed. That can cause a sense of unsuitableness in controlling the wide design range, which crosses cultural (social, historical, anthropological aspects) and scientific knowledge. Thus, the time to learn extends in lifelong education training.
   [Graphics]
   So, how can be the ws format useful in design education and practice? A ws is a short project experience, generally 4 to 7 days long, where people working on the same topic or interested on a given topic met in a define place to reach a common goal (create a project, reflect actively). Sometimes people already know the other participants since the ws is hosted in the same institution attended; more often the ws is in other cities/countries (generally the place is strongly related to the topic). Participants have in common the study/work field.
   The constant aspect is that people are quickly introduced in a unknown and limited* context from three points of view:
   Place: country-areas-inner resources available
   Time: start/end closed
   Social composition of the group [staff + participants].
   (* That will not change along the days)
   This sort of shared isolation where the context hold steady is an important element. Unknown space, a limited time and a social composition where one's behaviour/role is not immediately codified, compose the exceptional condition in which concentration and creativity are intensified. This gathering depends on many aspects: direct confrontation, a unique occasion to check one's capabilities, competition, the need to find solutions to the topic given, fast project realization (prototype), be innovative, the need to bring out one's capacities. Teaching methods change too: tutors are asked to propose specific design strategies and tools that could support fast processes.
   Finally, the goal asked have to be full of meaning but, of course, not perfect: in this way, ws format generates high level outputs thanks to the perfect dosage of abstraction, temporariness and learning through making.

TI Settlement scaling and increasing returns in an ancient society
SO SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA English
DT Article
AB A key property of modern cities is increasing returns to scale-the finding that many socioeconomic outputs increase more rapidly than their population size. Recent theoretical work proposes that this phenomenon is the result of general network effects typical of human social networks embedded in space and, thus, is not necessarily limited to modern settlements. We examine the extent to which increasing returns are apparent in archaeological settlement data from the pre-Hispanic Basin of Mexico. We review previous work on the quantitative relationship between population size and average settled area in this society and then present a general analysis of their patterns of monument construction and house sizes. Estimated scaling parameter values and residual statistics support the hypothesis that increasing returns to scale characterized various forms of socioeconomic production available in the archaeological record and are found to be consistent with key expectations from settlement scaling theory. As a consequence, these results provide evidence that the essential processes that lead to increasing returns in contemporary cities may have characterized human settlements throughout history, and demonstrate that increasing returns do not require modern forms of political or economic organization.

ID POWER LAWS
AB Built environments at any spatial scale are represented as sets of like objects-cities, neighbourhoods, buildings but also components such as streets, parks, etc.,-which are distributed spatially according to certain rules that we are only just beginning to detect and measure. Unlike normally distributed attributes of the population, these urban elements often scale according to forces that determine large numbers of small elements and a small number of large ones. While many objects evolve from small to large, not all objects can be large as resources as well as physical limits determine the distribution of their sizes. The theory behind such size distributions is referred to as scaling and the shape of such distributions is quite well-defined by various power and exponential laws. As objects grow and evolve, or are even designed, their form changes qualitatively due to the forces of competition and the constraints on space. Here we explore these ideas for cities, neighbourhoods in towns, and buildings, specifically high buildings, revealing that there are both important differences as well as similarities in their form, function, and structure.
