AB Background: Existing tools to evaluate costs do not always capture the heterogeneity of costs at the facility level. This study seeks to address this issue through an analysis of determinants of health facility immunization costs.
   Methods: A statistical analysis on facility routine delivery and vaccine costs was conducted using ordinary least squares tegression. Explanatory variables included the number of doses administered; proportion of time spent by facility staff on immunization; average staff wage; whether the health facility had enough staff; presence of cold chain equipment; distance to a vaccine collection point; and, facility ownership. Data were drawn from representative samples of primary care facilities in Benin and Ghana (46 and 50 facilities, respectively) collected as part of the EPIC studies.
   Results: Weighted average RI immunization facility cost was US$ 16,459 in Ghana and US$ 14,994 in Benin. The regression found total doses administered to be positively and significantly associated with facility cost in both countries. A 10% increase in doses resulted in a 4% increase in cost in Ghana, and a 7.5% increase in Benin. In Ghana, the proportion of immunization time, presence of cold chain, and sufficiency of staff were positively and significantly associated with total cost. In Benin, facility cost was negatively and significantly related to distance to the vaccine collection point. In the pooled sample, facilities in capital cities were associated with significantly higher costs.
   Conclusions: This study provides evidence on the importance of the level of scale in determining facility immunization cost, as well as the role of availability of health workers and time they spend on immunization in Ghana and Benin. This type of analysis can provide insights into the costs of scaling up immunization services, and can assist with development of more efficient immunization strategies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

TI Socio-Economic Instability and the Scaling of Energy Use with Population

ID DENSITY-DEPENDENCE; FERTILITY DECLINE; GROWTH; METABOLISM; SOCIETY;
   WEALTH; CITIES; SPACE
AB The size of the human population is relevant to the development of a sustainable world, yet the forces setting growth or declines in the human population are poorly understood. Generally, population growth rates depend on whether new individuals compete for the same energy (leading to Malthusian or density-dependent growth) or help to generate new energy (leading to exponential and super-exponential growth). It has been hypothesized that exponential and super-exponential growth in humans has resulted from carrying capacity, which is in part determined by energy availability, keeping pace with or exceeding the rate of population growth. We evaluated the relationship between energy use and population size for countries with long records of both and the world as a whole to assess whether energy yields are consistent with the idea of an increasing carrying capacity. We find that on average energy use has indeed kept pace with population size over long time periods. We also show, however, that the energy-population scaling exponent plummets during, and its temporal variability increases preceding, periods of social, political, technological, and environmental change. We suggest that efforts to increase the reliability of future energy yields may be essential for stabilizing both population growth and the global socio-economic system.

TI Monitoring HIV Drug Resistance Early Warning Indicators in Cameroon: A
   Study Following the Revised World Health Organization Recommendations
SO PLOS ONE

AB Background
   The majority (>95%) of new HIV infection occurs in resource-limited settings, and Cameroon is still experiencing a generalized epidemic with similar to 122,638 patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). A detrimental outcome in scaling-up ART is the emergence HIV drug resistance (HIVDR), suggesting the need for pragmatic approaches in sustaining a successful ART performance.
   Methods
   A survey was conducted in 15 ART sites of the Centre and Littoral regions of Cameroon in 2013 (10 urban versus 05 rural settings; 8 at tertiary/secondary versus 7 at primary healthcare levels), evaluating HIVDR-early warning indicators (EWIs) as-per the 2012 revised World Health Organization's guidelines: EWI1 (on-time pill pick-up), EWI2 (retention in care), EWI3 (no pharmacy stock-outs), EWI4 (dispensing practices), EWI5 (virological suppression). Poor performance was interpreted as potential HIVDR.
   Results
   Only 33.3% (4/12) of sites reached the desirable performance for "on-time pill pick-up" (57.1% urban versus 0% rural; p<0.0001) besides 25% (3/12) with fair performance. 69.2% (9/13) reached the desirable performance for "retention in care" (77.8% urban versus 50% rural; p=0.01) beside 7.7% (1/13) with fair performance. Only 14.4% (2/13) reached the desirable performance of "no pharmacy stock-outs" (11.1% urban versus 25% rural; p=0.02). All 15 sites reached the desirable performance of 0% "dispensing mono- or dual-therapy". Data were unavailable to evaluate "virological suppression" due to limited access to viral load testing (min-max: <1%-15%). Potential HIVDR was higher in rural (57.9%) compared to urban (27.8%) settings, p=0.02; and at primary (57.9%) compared to secondary/tertiary (33.3%) healthcare levels, p=0.09.
   Conclusions
   Delayed pill pick-up and pharmacy stock-outs are major factors favoring HIVDR emergence, with higher risks in rural settings and at primary healthcare. Retention in care appears acceptable in general while ART dispensing practices are standard. There is need to support patient-adherence to pharmacy appointments while reinforcing the national drug supply system.

AB Knowledge of the structure and morphology of common urban trees is scarce, particularly of the full life cycle of a tree. The present and future structural dimensions of urban tree species are of an increasing interest because tree growth is associated with its ecosystem services. The purpose of this study was to characterize the dimensions of two urban tree species (small-leaved lime, Tilia cordata Mill. and black locust, Robinia pseudoacacia L.) and to predict future structural dimensions based on the diameter at breast height and tree age. Regression equations were developed for tree height, crown diameter, crown height, crown volume, crown projection area, and open surface area of the tree pit. The data revealed strong relationships (r(2) > 0.7) between crown diameter, crown volume, crown projection area, crown height, tree pit for both species, and tree height of T. cordata. Based on tree dimensions and the leaf area index (LAI), three ecosystem services (carbon storage, shading, and cooling effects) were estimated for the analyzed trees. The results indicated that urban trees considerably improved the climate in cities, with carbon storage, shading, and cooling of single trees showing a direct relationship with LAI and age. The associations of tree growth patterns identified in this study can be used as guidelines for tree planting in cities and their ecosystem services; they may improve the management and planning of urban green areas.

AB This paper analyzes satellite data from downtown Shanghai, China, to investigate the long-range dependence of spatial patterns on urban impervious surfaces (UIS) using two-dimensional detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The UIS fraction is estimated from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus data from 1997 to 2010 using linear spectral mixture analysis. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of the UIS exhibits a positive spatial dependence, as revealed by Moran's index, capturing the evolution from aggregation to dispersion and back to aggregation during the study period. The use of two-dimensional DFA reveals a strong longrange power-law dependence in the UIS spatial pattern during the study period. The DFA scaling exponent can be seen as a measure of the uniformity of the UIS spatial distribution, and exhibits an approximate 1/f behaviour. Two-dimensional multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) confirmed that the UIS spatial pattern is not multifractal in nature, meaning that only a single scaling exponent is required to disclose the long-range dependence in the UIS spatial pattern. The application of two-dimensional DFA to UIS patterns should be viewed as a complementary tool to existing techniques, such as Fourier analysis, wavelets, and structure function, that can provide additional information aboutthe structure of UIS patterns, including its 1/f behaviour.
