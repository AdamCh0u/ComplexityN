AB This paper develops inter-relationships between planning 'culture', influential institutions and on-the-ground infrastructure-related outcomes in cities. The paper begins with a discussion of general trends across planning cultures and planning rhetoric, alongside tangible drivers of change in city infrastructure. Industry cultures, and the lines of discussion they produce in various locations, are seemingly influenced by person-to-person interaction as much as actual planning documentation or empirical evidence. We then develop a series of 'reference cities', which are clustered and cross-analysed primarily according to population scale and growth, and transport mode shares. Further intriguing comparison begins to emerge when attributes such as rail system scale are considered. Five different categories of city are ultimately developed - based on metropolitan population scaling. The paper then re-emphasises leading influences on urban policy and infrastructure outcomes (some are well-known, but others are sometimes either hidden from discussion or treated casually). Initially this involves detailing 'cultures' of planning on a linguistic or super-regional basis. It then involves qualitative inquiry into the drivers and priorities of a selection of prominent institutional exemplars in order to allow us clearer reflection on how these influencers might facilitate progress, or otherwise, on issues like smart growth and sustainable infrastructure development. Findings emphasise the idea that planning and infrastructure policy formulation and research should emerge beyond the current tendency for ad hoc and incoherent sources of influence. It should increasingly come from a stronger empirical base - in order to improve the implementation of advanced land use/transport infrastructure concepts in cities facing a globalised world of policy challenges.

AB Various aspects of the built environment have important effects on ecology. Providing suitable metrics for the built forms so as to quantify and model their internal relations and external ecological footprints, however, remains a challenge. Here we provide such metrics focusing on the spatial distribution of 11,418 buildings within the city of Geneva, Switzerland. The size distributions of areas, perimeters, and volumes of the buildings follow approximately power laws, whereas the heights of the buildings follow a bimodal (two-peak) distributions. Using the Gibbs-Shannon entropy formula, we calculated area, perimeter, volume, and height entropies for 16 neighbourhoods (zones) in Geneva and show that they have positive correlations (R-2= 0.43-0.84) with the average values of these parameters. Furthermore, the entropies of area, perimeter, and volume themselves are all positively correlated (R-2 = 0.87-0.91). Deriving entropy from Helmholtz free energy, we interpret entropy as a measure of spreading or expansion and provide an analogy between the entropy increase during the expansion of a solid and the entropy increase with the expansion of the built-up area in Geneva. Compactness of cities is widely thought to affect their ecology. Here we use the density of buildings and transport infrastructure as a measure of compactness. The results show negative correlation (R-2 = 0.39-0.54) between building density and the entropies of building area, perimeter, and volume. The calculated length-size distributions of the street network shows a negative correlations (R-2= 0.70-0.76) with the number of streets per unit area as well as with the total street length per unit area. The number of buildings as well as populations (number of people) show sub-linear relations with both the annual heat demand (MJ) and CO2 emissions (kg) for the 16 neighbourhoods. These relations imply that the heat demand and CO2 emissions grow at a slower rate than either the number of buildings or the population. More specifically, the relations can be interpreted so that 1% increase in the number of buildings or the population is associated with some 0.8-0.9% increase in heat demand and CO2 emissions. Thus, in terms of number of buildings and populations, large neighbourhoods have proportionally less ecological footprints than smaller neighbourhoods. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Design spectrum (DS) model is typically specified in a seismic code of practice for structural design. In a region of low-to-moderate seismicity where seismic code does not exist, a DS model in a well established code of practice is usually adopted, while the suitability of such model has seldom been evaluated. In this article, the elastic DS models for reference (rock) site stipulated in six major codes of practice (AS1170.4-2007, EN1998-1:2004, GB50011-2010, IBC-2012, NBCC-2010 and NZS1170.5:2004) have been compared and scrutinized. Three cities of low-to-moderate seismicity, namely, Melbourne (Australia), Hong Kong (China) and Karlsruhe (Germany), have been selected for illustrative purposes. Particular emphasis has been put on the parameterization scheme for DS model. It is found that huge discrepancies (over 100%) exist among the models, especially at the long period range, due to differences in spectral shapes and the recommended corner periods, which would lead to undesirable effects on the use of the displacement-based seismic design approach. It is urged that the values of corner periods should be determined specifically and cautiously based on the regional seismicity pattern and local geological conditions.

AB The movement of large numbers of vehicles along the complex network of roads in a city result in interactions between them that become stronger as the traffic density increases. The non-trivial behavior arising from the collective dynamics of vehicles include the occurrence of persistent congestion at different points of the transport network that typically reduce the efficiency of overall traffic flow. In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for the characteristic spatio-temporal patterns of urban traffic, we first need to identify statistically robust features from empirical observations, which one can then try to recreate in computational models of traffic dynamics. In this article, we have analyzed the GPS traces collected round the clock for more than a hundred taxis operating in a major Indian city over a period of 1 month. The available information allows us to precisely measure the periods during which the vehicle is static and when it is moving. We focus on the intermittent patterns of rest and motion that a car exhibits during its passage through city traffic, which provides a window into key aspects of collective dynamics resulting from congestion. We show that the distribution of waiting time, i.e., the period during which a car is static between two successive epochs of movement, has a highly skewed nature. The bulk of the probability distribution appears to follow power-law scaling with exponent value of 1.78. As city traffic has very different densities during peak hours and off-peak hours, we have also investigated this distribution at different times of the day. While the power-law scaling is found to be robust, the exact value of the exponent does change slightly. We have also considered the active time distribution, i.e., the period of movement between two epochs when the car is static, which does not exhibit a power-law signature but rather resembles a inverse Gaussian or a log-logistic distribution. We also look at the recurrence relation between the durations of successive waiting times, as well as, that between active time duration and the duration of the preceding waiting time. Our results can be used to help understand how the statistical properties of large-scale traffic movement over complex road networks which characterize cities deviate from that of other types of collective dynamics, e.g., the diffusion of random walkers.

AB The TSI Fast Mobility Particle Sizer (FMPS) and Engine Exhaust Particle Sizer (EEPS) provide size distributions for 6-560 nm particles with a time resolution suitable for characterizing transient particle sources; however, the accuracy of these instruments can be source dependent, due to influences of particle morphology. The aim of this study was to develop a source-independent correction protocol for the FMPS and EEPS. The correction protocol consists of: (1) broadening the >80 nm size range of the distribution to account for under-sizing by the FMPS and EEPS; (2) applying an existing correction protocol in the 8-93 nm size range; and (3) dividing each size bin by the ratio of total concentration measured by the FMPS or EEPS and a water-based Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) as a surrogate scaling factor to account for particle morphology. Efficacy of the correction protocol was assessed for three sources: urban ambient air, diluted gasoline direct injection engine exhaust, and diluted diesel engine exhaust. Linear regression against a reference instrument, the Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), before and after applying the correction protocol demonstrated that the correction ensured agreement within 20%.
