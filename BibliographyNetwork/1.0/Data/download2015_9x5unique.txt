AB In the Internet of Things (IoT) era, an increasing number of data management applications, such as for connected vehicles and smarter cities, face the challenge of querying and analyzing massive volumes of spatiotemporal data. These applications frequently perform queries that join moving objects with spatial data, such as selecting sub-tracks crossing a bridge. However, spatiotemporal queries are not well supported or natively supported by current state-of-the-art relational database systems. Most of existing systems build a spatial index directly over the raw spatiotemporal data, which leads to performance issues when scaling out for both indexing and query. In this paper, we focus on building a SpatioTemporal historian as a Service (STaaS) by extending the IBM Bluemix TimeSeries Database service. The STaaS service manages to process spatiotemporal queries over high volume historical data. The experiments show that STaaS service could easily scale out by adding shards, and achieve dramatic speed-up on spatiotemporal query with support of our hybrid data store. Moreover, we have already deployed STaaS on Bluemix Staging (Internal User Testing) Zone to collect feedback for improvement before porting it into the product zone in the future.

AB The increasing frequency of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater systems is a commonly recognized problem due to detrimental effects on water quality. Vancouver Lake, a shallow, tidally influenced lake in the flood plain of the Columbia River within the city of Vancouver, WA, USA, has experienced numerous summertime cyanobacterial blooms, dominated by Aphanizomenon sp. and Anabaena sp. Cyanobacteria abundance and toxin (microcystin) levels have been monitored in this popular urban lake for several years; however, no previous studies have identified which cyanobacteria species produce toxins, nor analyzed how changes in environmental variables contribute to the fluctuations in toxic cyanobacteria populations. We used a suite of molecular techniques to analyze water samples from Vancouver Lake over two summer bloom cycles (2009 and 2010). Both intracellular and extracellular microcystin concentrations were measured using an ELISA kit. Intracellular microcystin concentrations exceeded WHO guidelines for recreational waters several times throughout the sampling period. PCR results demonstrated that Microcystis sp. was the sole microcystin-producing cyanobacteria species present in Vancouver Lake, although Microcystis sp. was rarely detected in microscopical counts. qPCR results indicated that the majority of the Microcystis sp. population contained the toxin-producing gene (mcyE), although Microcystis sp. abundance rarely exceeded 1 percent of overall cyanobacteria abundance. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) revealed that PO4-P was the main environmental variable influencing the abundance of toxic and non-toxic cyanobacteria, as well as intracellular microcystin concentrations. Our study underscores the importance of using molecular genetic techniques, in addition to traditional microscopy, to assess the importance of less conspicuous species in the dynamics of harmful algal blooms.

AB Scaling and multifractal properties of the hourly PM2.5 average concentration series at the four air monitoring stations of Chengdu (southwestern China) were explored by using a multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis method, during a typical haze episode (from 1 March to 17 March, 2013). Using shuffling procedure and phase randomization procedure, the major sources of multifractality in these PM2.5 series are studied. The results show that the multifractality nature of PM2.5 series is mainly due to long-range correlation. At the same time, the non-Gaussian probability distributions also partly contribute to the multifractal behaviour. The scale-free power laws behaviours are found to govern the cumulative distributions statistics for PM2.5 concentration fluctuations. The temporal evolutions of the multifractality were investigated by the approach of a sliding window. Further, we attempt to find the answers to the following questions: how does long-range correlation and power-law distribution in PM2.5 evolution emerge? It is inviting to do it in a self-organized criticality (SOC) framework, which was specially designed to model the dynamics of complex systems. A novel PM2.5 evolution model is developed on the bases of SOC theory. The model displays robust power law behaviour in certain dynamical region. The self-organized criticality properties of PM2.5 evolution are discussed. This SOC behaviour is related to a statistically steady state that implies the presence of long-range correlation and power-law distribution in PM2.5 evolution during the haze period. It is the stability of SOC that causes the haze period to be sustained for a long time in Chengdu.

AB India being an overpopulated developing country, poverty and unemployment are commonly observed and Government struggles to provide basic health services to all its citizens, particularly the poor. Despite several efforts made by the Government, Human Development Report of 2014 released by UNDP indicated that India ranks 135 out of 186 countries on its human development index (HDI) a composite measure of life expectancy, access to education and income levels. Clearly poverty being the root cause of all health issues, like maternal and infant mortality, malnutrition & starvation, all of them culminate into health related disasters.
   Right from independence, Government of India has initiated number of health programs for the benefit of poor across the country. National Health Mission (NHM) is one such program. Initially the Government focused on to addressing the health needs of under-served rural areas in the country through National Rural Health Mission (NRHM 2005). Thrust of the mission has been establishing a fully functional, community owned decentralized health delivery system. As per the 12th Five year Plan the flagship program of NRHM was strengthened under the umbrella of National Health Mission (NHM). The focus on covering rural areas and rural population continued along with up-scaling of NRHM to include non-communicable diseases and expanding health coverage to urban areas. Government of India launched the National Urban Health Mission (NUHM) as a sub-mission of an overarching National Health Mission (NHM), along with National Rural Health Mission (NRHM) in 2013.
   NHM aims at reducing infant and maternal mortality rate, universal access to public health services, prevention and control of diseases, increased access to primary health care, population stabilization along with gender and demographic balance and increased life span levels through well chalked strategies like promotion of accredited social health activists (ASHA) at household level, health plan through village health committees, strengthening the PHCs and CHCs, promotion of hospital management committees, health care contractors, mobile health services, free ambulance services, free drugs and diagnostic services along with mother and child care units which take care of pregnancy and child delivery complications through sub policies like Janani and Shishu Suraksha Yojanas both in rural and urban areas. This paper makes a comprehensive study of the NHM policy and its implications on Indian health sector.

AB Background: Globally mental health problems are a serious public health concern. Currently four out of five people with severe mental illness in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC) receive no effective treatment. There is an urgent need to address this enormous treatment gap. Changing the focus of specialist mental health workers (psychiatrists and psychologists) from only service delivery to also designing and managing mental health services; building clinical capacity of the primary health care (PHC) workers, and providing supervision and quality assurance of mental health services may help in scaling up mental health services in LMICs. Little is known however, about the mental health policy and services context for these strategies in fragile-state settings, such as Nepal.
   Method: A standard situation analysis tool was developed by the PRogramme for Improving Mental health carE (PRIME) consortium to systematically analyze and describe the current gaps in mental health care in Nepal, in order to inform the development of a district level mental health care plan (MHCP). It comprised six sections; general information (e.g. population, socio-economic conditions); mental health policies and plans; mental health treatment coverage; district health services; and community services. Data was obtained from secondary sources, including scientific publications, reports, project documents and hospital records.
   Results: Mental health policy exists in Nepal, having been adopted in 1997, but implementation of the policy framework has yet to begin. In common with other LMICs, the budget allocated for mental health is minimal. Mental health services are concentrated in the big cities, with 0.22 psychiatrists and 0.06 psychologists per 100,000 population. The key challenges experienced in developing a district level MHCP included, overburdened health workers, lack of psychotropic medicines in the PHC, lack of mental health supervision in the existing system, and lack of a coordinating body in the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP). Strategies to overcome these challenges included involvement of MoHP in the process, especially by providing psychotropic medicines and appointing a senior level officer to facilitate project activities, and collaboration with National Health Training Centers (NHTC) in training programs.
   Conclusions: This study describes many challenges facing mental health care in Nepal. Most of these challenges are not new, yet this study contributes to our understanding of these difficulties by outlining the national and district level factors that have a direct influence on the development of a district level mental health care plan.
