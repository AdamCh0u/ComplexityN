AB Background: Despite the health benefits of regular physical activity, most children are insufficiently active. Schools are ideally placed to promote physical activity; however, many do not provide children with sufficient in-school activity or ensure they have the skills and motivation to be active beyond the school setting. The aim of this project is to modify, scale up and evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention previously shown to be efficacious in improving children's physical activity, fundamental movement skills and cardiorespiratory fitness. The 'Internet-based Professional Learning to help teachers support Activity in Youth' (iPLAY) study will focus largely on online delivery to enhance translational capacity.
   Methods/Design: The intervention will be implemented at school and teacher levels, and will include six components: (i) quality physical education and school sport, (ii) classroom movement breaks, (iii) physically active homework, (iv) active playgrounds, (v) community physical activity links and (vi) parent/caregiver engagement. Experienced physical education teachers will deliver professional learning workshops and follow-up, individualized mentoring to primary teachers (i.e., Kindergarten - Year 6). These activities will be supported by online learning and resources. Teachers will then deliver the iPLAY intervention components in their schools. We will evaluate iPLAY in two complementary studies in primary schools across New South Wales (NSW), Australia. A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), involving a representative sample of 20 schools within NSW (1: 1 allocation at the school level to intervention and attention control conditions), will assess effectiveness and cost-effectiveness at 12 and 24 months. Students' cardiorespiratory fitness will be the primary outcome in this trial. Key secondary outcomes will include students' moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (via accelerometers), fundamental movement skill proficiency, enjoyment of physical education and sport, cognitive control, performance on standardized tests of numeracy and literacy, and cost-effectiveness. A scale-up implementation study guided by the RE-AIM framework will evaluate the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the intervention when delivered in 160 primary schools in urban and regional areas of NSW.
   Discussion: This project will provide the evidence and a framework for government to guide physical activity promotion throughout NSW primary schools and a potential model for adoption in other states and countries.

AB We utilize the distribution of PM2.5 concentration and population in large cities at the global scale to illustrate the relationship between urbanization and urban air quality. We found: 1) The relationship varies greatly among continents and countries. Large cities in North America, Europe, and Latin America have better air quality than those in other continents, while those in China and India have the worst air quality. 2) The relationships between urban population size and PM2.5 concentration in large cities of different continents or countries were different. PM2.5 concentration in large cities in North America, Europe, and Latin America showed little fluctuation or a small increasing trend, but those in Africa and India represent a "U" type relationship and in China represent an inverse "U" type relationship. 3) The potential contribution of population to PM2.5 concentration was higher in the large cities in China and India, but lower in other large cities.

AB In urban areas, there is a need to evaluate the dynamics and impacts of impending disasters, in order to ensure planning for resilience, emergency actions, and humanitarian support. In this respect, a Bucharest area that suffered a deep trauma in the 1980s was studied. The total or partial demolition of the old urban fabric was ordered by the authoritarian regime to build a new Civic Center. The area was declared as a protected built area in the 1990s. The inventory of the building stock was done in the framework of this project, based on data on building's age, height, and materials. Additionally, the cultural value was studied with scoring criteria and methods, based on the six scaling stages of the Romanian Law of Monuments. The functional value, as well as the seismic damage and vulnerability, was evaluated for existing building classes. The paper presents examples of multihazard scenarios elaborated for this area, considering earthquakes, flooding, and terrorist attacks on public institutions. The spatial databases and online tools were used for mapping the buildings, as well as hazard impacts. According to the results of the above scenarios, shelters/security centers can be created, for earthquake evacuation, in the nearby "Mihai Eminescu" College while, for high-level flooding, the refuge and shelter area should be located in a higher place, near the Academy House or the Romanian Parliament. For other hazards, a center located either at "Mihai Eminescu" College or in Izvor Park is recommended.

AB Recent advances in the urban science make broad use of the notion of scaling. We focus here on the important scaling relationship between the gross metropolitan product (GMP) of a city and its population (pop). It has been demonstrated that GMP alpha Y Ypop(beta) with beta always greater than 1 and close to 1.2. This fundamental finding highlights a universal rule that holds across countries and cultures and might explain the very nature of cities. However, in an increasingly connected world, the hypothesis that the economy of a city solely depends on its population might be questionable. Using data for 248 cities in the European Union between 2005 and 2010, we found a double GMP/pop scaling regime. For West EU cities, beta = 1 over the whole the period, while for post-communist cities beta > 1 and increases from similar to 1.2 to similar to 1.4. The evolution of the scaling exponent describes the convergence of postcommunist European cities to open and liberal economies. We propose a simple model of economic convergence in which, under stable political conditions, a linear GMP/pop scaling is expected for all cities. The results suggest that the GMP/pop super-linear scaling represents a phase of economic growth rather than a steady, universal urban feature. The results also suggest that relationships between cities are embedded in their political and economic context and cannot be neglected in explanations of cities, urbanization and urban economics.

AB Urban heat environment has a close relation with quality of life of urban citizens. Land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from remotely sensed thermal infrared imagery can be used for urban heat environment studies. However, the rather low spatial resolution of currently available remote sensing thermal imagery (e.g., Landsat ETM+, its thermal band is in the spectral range of 10.40-12.51 mu m and at 60 m spatial resolution) has become the bottleneck for its further application in the real word. By using the spatial downscaling techniques, different spectral bands with various spatial resolution from the same remote sensor can be integrated and fully utilized, thus the improvement of the spatial resolution of the thermal imagery can be realized. So far, various algorithms or methods for spatial downscaling of remotely sensed thermal images have been put forward. Among them, the HUTS (High-resolution urban thermal sharpener) algorithm, proposed by Dominguez et al. (2011), has been accepted and used by many researchers. However, its applicability in more study areas with more remotely sensed data, especially recently launched data (like Landsat-8 data), still need to be further examined. In this paper, taking Xiamen City, China as the study area, the original HUTS method was modified and improved by taking the following two measures: (1) introducing a new parameter, namely, land surface emissivity; (2) replacing the original scaling factor NDVI with fractional vegetation cover. A Landsat-8 (path 119, row 43) imagery, acquired on August 4, 2013, was used and the revised Generalized Single-channel Method proposed by Jimenez-Munoz and Sobrino (2014) was applied to retrieve LST in this study. A full assessment and comparison of the original and the modified HUTS algorithms were made, both from the qualitative and the quantitative (by using multiple indices, such as R, RMSE, RMSPE, RASE, and so on) perspectives. The research results showed that, the modified HUTS algorithm, presented in this study, had better performance than the original one, thus was proposed as a useful technique of spatial downscaling of thermal infrared image in future urban heat environment studies.
