AB Multispecies and multiscale habitat suitability models (HSM) are important to identify the environmental variables and scales influencing habitat selection and facilitate the comparison of closely related species with different ecological requirements.
   This study explores the multiscale relationships of habitat suitability for the pine (Martes martes) and stone marten (M. foina) in northern Spain to evaluate differences in habitat selection and scaling, and to determine if there is habitat niche displacement when both species coexist.
   We combined bivariate scaling and maximum entropy modeling to compare the multiscale habitat selection of the two martens. To optimize the HSM, the performance of three sampling bias correction methods at four spatial scales was explored. HSMs were compared to explore niche differentiation between species through a niche identity test.
   The comparison among HSMs resulted in the detection of a significant niche divergence between species. The pine marten was positively associated with cooler mountainous areas, low levels of human disturbance, high proportion of natural forests and well-connected forestry plantations, and medium-extent agroforestry mosaics. The stone marten was positively related to the density of urban areas, the proportion and extensiveness of croplands, the existence of some scrub cover and semi-continuous grasslands.
   This study outlines the influence of the spatial scale and the importance of the sampling bias corrections in HSM, and to our knowledge, it is the first comparing multiscale habitat selection and niche divergence of two related marten species. This study provides a useful methodological framework for multispecies and multiscale comparatives.

AB Local and central authorities have long been interested in taking advantage of investments in mass transit to achieve more sustainable urban development. In the case of Santiago de Chile, a highly income segregated metropolis that also suffers an increasing urban sprawl, its underground (Metro) and BRT corridor networks offer a unique chance to revert these malaises. In effect, Santiago's modern transit infrastructure is undercapitalized, there are many areas with little or no development in the vicinity of Metro and BRT stations that could be densified providing housing to the growing population, and hopefully even turned into sub centres with urban equipment, servicing the poorer areas, thus diminishing social and spatial segregation.
   We sought to understand and measure how different government incentive packages could attract private investment into such areas. We used a combination of stated choice and best-worst scaling data to examine the potential power of various government grants to encourage density development, including social integration, at these locations. Our results allowed us to identify a typology of urban areas that respond differently to the incentive packages. The differentiated analysis of the urban areas, their tendencies and perception of potential real estate developers is a significant first step to design ad hoc strategies to encourage sustainable development in the surroundings of Metro and BRT stations.

   evaluation framework
AB This paper presents the results of a comprehensive evaluation exercise conducted in a multi-country service innovation pilot involving four European Cities (Aalborg, DK; Birmingham, UK; Lisbon, PT; and Milan, IT) in the context of a EU funded Smart City project, MyNeighbourhood. We introduce a 7-dimensional framework that was adopted as a theoretical lens to identify "the seeds of scalability" in each pilot environment. We briefly outline and discuss the results of framework implementation, which were shared with the local stakeholders. We believe this framework brings some value, particularly in providing a full picture of the relevant analytical dimensions for innovation scaling, which should be taken into account during the planning and execution of any such action, or simply considered as potential obstacles or enablers in the context of a fully blown evaluation.

AB The paper explores the ability of urban transition experiments to transform the development regime in which they are embedded. Using three European case studies - BedZed, Vauban and Hammarby - it investigates the processes of broadening and scaling up within cities, nations and across cities globally; and finds that transition experiments do influence the development regime in which they are embedded. The impact of experiments on the development regime does vary significantly with scale. The innovative components, which are assembled in experiments (cultural, structural and practices) also seem to have differing propensity to influence the development regime at different scales. Thus, cultural innovations have a greater propensity to influence the development regime across all scales, whilst the structural and practice innovations tend to influence the development regime locally and nationally. The case studies also demonstrated the significance of context (historical and geographical) in shaping experiments and influencing the transformation process. This finding suggests that the importance of broadening in the transformation process has been overstated. The experiments show that broadening across national boundaries and for prolonged periods, can result in expanding niche-regimes which become increasingly diverse. But it does not result in transformation. (C) 2016 The Author. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The Cost of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision in South Africa

   ACQUISITION; MEN
AB Given compelling evidence associating voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) with men's reduced HIV acquisition through heterosexual intercourse, South Africa in 2010 began scaling up VMMC. To project the resources needed to complete 4.3 million circumcisions between 2010 and 2016, we (1) estimated the unit cost to provide VMMC; (2) assessed cost drivers and cost variances across eight provinces and VMMC service delivery modes; and (3) evaluated the costs associated with mobilize and motivate men and boys to access VMMC services. Cost data were systematically collected and analyzed using a provider's perspective from 33 Government and PEPFAR-supported (U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) urban, rural, and peri-urban VMMC facilities. The cost per circumcision performed in 2014 was US$132 (R1,431): higher in public hospitals (US$158 [R1,710]) than in health centers and clinics (US$121 [R1,309]). There was no substantial difference between the cost at fixed circumcision sites and fixed sites that also offer outreach services. Direct labor costs could be reduced by 17% with task shifting from doctors to professional nurses; this could have saved as much as $15 million (R163.20 million) in 2015, when the goal was 1.6 million circumcisions. About $14.2 million (R154 million) was spent on medical male circumcision demand creation in South Africa in 2014-D primarily on personnel, including community mobilizers (36%), and on small and mass media promotions (35%). Calculating the unit cost of VMMC demand creation was daunting, because data on the denominator (number of people reached with demand creation messages or number of people seeking VMMC as a result of demand creation) were not available. Because there are no "dose-response" data on demand creation ($X in demand creation will result in an additional Z% increase in VMMC clients), research is needed to determine the appropriate amount and allocation of demand creation resources.
