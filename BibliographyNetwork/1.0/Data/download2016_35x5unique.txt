TI Volunteer-led free dental outreach clinics in semi-urban Uganda: a

SO BRITISH DENTAL JOURNAL

ID BASIC PACKAGE; ORAL CARE; CARIES
AB Background The global burden of dental disease remains a key global public health issue, with the prevalence of common pathologies grossly unchanged over the last two decades. Poor oral health impacts individuals on a personal and economic level and incurs a significant cost globally. The role of dental aid organisations in strategies to deliver dental health services has long been debated. Methods We launched a dental clinic at the premises of an established non-governmental organisation. All patients were taught a locally developed oral hygiene educational module before receiving a thorough examination. Treatments offered included simple scaling, fluoride application, treatment of infection and extraction. Results Three dental clinics were conducted. A total of 93 patients registered. Thirty nine (42%) were male, with an average age of 20 years (range 5-70 years). Eighty-six percent of patients presented in pain. Five (5.4%) of the patients were found to have sound teeth. Forty-three (46%) patients had at least one tooth extraction. Twenty-six percent of patients were referred for restorations. The treatment provided equated to 178 units of dental activity (UDAs). The total cost per patient was 1.82 pound, regardless of treatment, or 0.95 pound per UDA. Discussion and conclusion We demonstrated a distinct need for dental healthcare in this area, an acceptability of our service, potential for sustainability, and a dedication towards providing a basic package of oral care. We call for a reignition of debate regarding the role of dental aid organisations in the provision of global oral healthcare.

TI Dynamics of Urban Traffic Congestion: A kinetic Monte Carlo approach to

AB Transitions observed in the dynamical patterns of vehicular traffic, for instance, as a result of changes in traffic density, form an important class of phenomena that is sought to be explained by large-scale modeling using many interacting agents. While the dynamics of highway traffic has been the subject of intense investigation over the last few decades, there is as yet comparatively little understanding of the patterns of urban traffic. The macroscopic collective behavior of cars in the network of roads inside a city is marked by relatively high vehicular densities and the presence of signals that coordinate movement of cross-flowing traffic traveling along several directions. In this article, we have presented a novel kinetic Monte Carlo simulation approach for studying the dynamics of urban traffic congestion. This allows us to study continuous-time, continuous-space models of traffic flow in the presence of stochastic fluctuations, which contrast with the dominant paradigm of cellular automata models. We first reproduce well-known results of such discrete models for traffic flow in the absence of any intersections, and then, show the corresponding behavior in the presence of an intersection where cross-flowing traffic is regulated by a signal. The fundamental diagram of traffic flow in the presence of a signal shows a broad plateau indicating that the flow is almost independent of small variations in vehicle density for an intermediate range of densities. This is unlike the case where there are no intersections, where a sharp transition is observed between free flow behavior and jamming on changing vehicle density. The distribution of congestion times shows a power-law scaling regime over an extended range for the stochastic case when exponential-like right skewed probability distributions are used. These results reproduce in a simple setting the empirically observed power-law behavior in congestion time distributions for Indian urban traffic that is validated here with a much larger data-set.

TI Spatially resolved flux measurements of NOx from London suggest

AB To date, direct validation of city-wide emissions inventories for air pollutants has been difficult or impossible. However, recent technological innovations now allow direct measurement of pollutant fluxes from cities, for comparison with emissions inventories, which are themselves commonly used for prediction of current and future air quality and to help guide abatement strategies. Fluxes of NOx were measured using the eddy-covariance technique from an aircraft flying at low altitude over London. The highest fluxes were observed over central London, with lower fluxes measured in suburban areas. A footprint model was used to estimate the spatial area from which the measured emissions occurred. This allowed comparison of the flux measurements to the UK's National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) for NOx, with scaling factors used to account for the actual time of day, day of week and month of year of the measurement. The comparison suggests significant underestimation of NOx emissions in London by the NAEI, mainly due to its under-representation of real world road traffic emissions. A comparison was also carried out with an enhanced version of the inventory using real world driving emission factors and road measurement data taken from the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (LAEI). The measurement to inventory agreement was substantially improved using the enhanced version, showing the importance of fully accounting for road traffic, which is the dominant NOx emission source in London. In central London there was still an underestimation by the inventory of 30-40% compared with flux measurements, suggesting significant improvements are still required in the NOx emissions inventory.

AB Despite the growth of adaptation plans and action by municipalities, there are limited examples of opportunities for effectively mainstreaming climate adaptation into policy and practice in local government. This paper uses the experiment of co-producing an adaptation plan for a small municipality in the Western Cape Province, South Africa, to illustrate how opportunities were leveraged. The findings suggest that a shift from strengthening the science-policy interface to the knowledge-policy interface might be more appropriate in the context of adaptation planning that requires an understanding of the local context as well as of global science. In order to align adaptation plans with developmental priorities and to secure support from actors at multiple levels, the integration of multiple knowledge forms, including climate science, should be prioritized. Such a task could be strengthened if co-production is prioritized. Building on these opportunities is critical to scaling up adaptation in local government and building on its transformative potential.

TI Nigeria's Government Spending on Basic Education and Healthcare in the
   Last Decade: What has Changed After Reforms?

AB Government spending can be effective and have the desired effect on the level of socioeconomic development when there is consistency and compliance of government agencies with the development agenda a nation adopts. Social indicators (education and healthcare) in Nigeria over the past decade have not been on track with the distributive outcome targets set by the 2004 social sector reforms despite scaling up funding in the two key social sectors (education and healthcare). The study employs a welfare distribution analysis through concentration curves and conducting several dominance tests to ascertain who benefited from public spending in these sectors. Findings suggest that apart from public primary education and healthcare for urban residents, no other level of social service was absolutely progressive for all or by gender or by location. These results were not better than the results of 2003 before these reforms were introduced. The study therefore recommends that strengthening policies should be followed by institutional intensification and other several interrelated areas to attain effectiveness of public spending. Also budget drafting in the executive and legislature must be guided by relevant priority documentation while project costs should be realistic and not inflated as evidenced by several other similar studies and reviews to achieve its desired goals.
