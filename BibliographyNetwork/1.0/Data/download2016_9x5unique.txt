AB As unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is applied in small area aerial photogrammetry surveying, disaster monitoring and emergency command, 3D urban construction and other fields, the image processing of UAV has become a hot topic in current research. The precise matching of UAV image is a key problem, which affects the subsequent processing precision directly, such as 3D reconstruction and automatic aerial triangulation, etc. At present, SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm proposed by DAVID G. LOWE as the main method is, is widely used in image matching, since its strong stability to image rotation, shift, scaling, and the change of illumination conditions. It has been successfully applied in target recognition, SFM (Structure from Motion), and many other fields. SIFT algorithm needs the colour images to be converted into grayscale images, detects extremum points under different scales and uses neighbourhood pixels to generate descriptor. As we all know that UAV images with rich colour information, the SIFT algorithm improved through combining with the image colour information in this paper, the experiments are conducted from matching efficiency and accuracy compared with the original SIFT algorithm. The results show that the method which proposed in this paper decreases on the efficiency, but is improved on the precision and provides a basis choice for matching method.

AB Background and objectives In the Control of Blood Pressure and Risk Attenuation trial, a 2X2 factorial design study (2004-2007), the combined home health education and trained general practitioner intervention delivered over 2 years was more effective than no intervention (usual care) in lowering systolic BP among adults with hypertension in urban Pakistan. We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the interventions on kidney function.
   Design, participants, settings, & methods In 2012-2013, we conducted extended follow-up of a total of 1271 individuals aged >= 40 years with hypertension (systolic BP >= 140 mmHg, diastolic BP >= 90 mmHg, or receipt of antihypertensive treatment) and serum creatinine measurements with 2 years in-trial and 5 years of post-trial period in 12 randomly selected low-income communities in Karachi, Pakistan. The change in eGFR from baseline to 7 years was assessed among randomized groups using a generalized estimating equation method with multiple imputation of missing values.
   Results At 7 years of follow-up, adjusted mean eGFR remained unchanged, with a change of -0.3 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], -3.5 to 2.9) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) among adults randomly assigned to the combined home health education plus trained general practitioner intervention compared with a significant decline of -3.6 (95% CI, -5.7 to -2.0) ml/min per 1.73 m(2) in those assigned to usual care (P=0.01, modified intention-to-treat analysis). The risk for the combined intervention of death from kidney failure or >20% decline in eGFR relative to usual care was significantly reduced (risk ratio, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.25 to 0.89).
   Conclusions The combined home health education plus trained general practitioner intervention is beneficial in preserving kidney function among adults with hypertension in communities in Karachi. These findings highlight the importance of scaling up simple strategies for renal risk reduction in low- and middle-income countries.

AB The novel concept of the RADIUS technology, an acronym for Range Adaptable Device Incorporating Unique Scaling, is unique in the way performed by TDW. The control of warhead output can be achieved within a compact fuzing system incorporating two pyrotechnical outputs: one output is used for initiating a classical detonation and the other one for initiating a distinctive subdetonative mechanism. Such an enhanced weapon with a discrete number of output modes allows scaling of blast / fragmentation effects and respective lethal and collateral damages footprints against surface targets.
   RADIUS technology prototypes based on a 500 lb (MK-82 / BLU-111) precision-guided bomb recently demonstrated their minimum and maximum output modes against a comprehensive target set consisting of various witness panels and SUV cars. These tests were conducted jointly with BAE Systems, Munitions. The different outputs and their resulting level of damages can be clearly observed. High-speed video sequences of the subdetonative reactions leading to regular fractures of the bomb casing suggest a highly controlled and repeatable underlying process. This was also modeled utilizing Lee-Tarver's extended Ignition and Growth model with a single robust parameter set reproducing well different charge dimensions.
   Vulnerability / lethality assessments for various output modes of a 500 lb precision-guided bomb were conducted to demonstrate these new operational capabilities in joint fire support simulations and in a realistic urban environment. Implementing this technology into a variety of bombs or missile warheads for surface attacks will allow cost-effective solutions through the life cycle, since the mix of weapon types can be reduced and so does the integration effort into weapon systems / platforms as well as logistical constraints.

ID CITIES; NETWORKS; SIZE
AB Do scaling relations always provide the means to anticipate the relationships between the size of cities, costs of maintenance, and the socio-economic benefits resulting from their growth? Scaling laws are considered a universal principle that describes the development of complex systems such as cities. It seems that regardless of their location or history, the growth of cities is associated with the super-linear or sublinear scaling of features such as the amount of space required, infrastructure, or human activities. However, the results of our research, based on grouping by Self-Organizing Maps, reveal some limitations in the application of scaling laws: the trends of urban growth behave in a different manner when we consider both a large and diverse collection of cities and a subset of cities alike. This finding complements the existing body of knowledge on the growth of cities and allows for a more accurate prediction of their future.

AB Background: Indigenous primary health-care (PHC) services participating in continuous quality improvement (CQI) cycles show varying patterns of performance over time. Understanding this variation is essential to scaling up and sustaining quality improvement initiatives. The aim of this study is to examine trends in quality of care for services participating in the ABCD National Research Partnership and describe patterns of change over time and examine health service characteristics associated with positive and negative trends in quality of care.
   Setting and participants: PHC services providing care for Indigenous people in urban, rural, and remote northern Australia that had completed at least three annual audits of service delivery for at least one aspect of care (n = 73).
   Methods/design: Longitudinal clinical audit data from use of four clinical audit tools (maternal health, child health, preventive health, Type 2 diabetes) between 2005 and 2013 were analyzed. Health center performance was classified into six patterns of change over time: consistent high improvement (positive), sustained high performance (positive), decline (negative), marked variability (negative), consistent low performance (negative), and no specific increase or decrease (neutral). Backwards stepwise multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the associations between health service characteristics and positive or negative trends in quality of care.
   Results: Trends in quality of care varied widely between health services across the four audit tools. Regression analyses of health service characteristics revealed no consistent statistically significant associations of population size, remoteness, governance model, or accreditation status with positive or negative trends in quality of care.
   Conclusion: The variable trends in quality of care as reflected by CQI audit tools do not appear to be related to easily measurable health service characteristics. This points to the need for a deeper or more nuanced understanding of factors that moderate the effect of CQI on health service performance for the purpose of strengthening enablers and overcoming barriers to improvement.
