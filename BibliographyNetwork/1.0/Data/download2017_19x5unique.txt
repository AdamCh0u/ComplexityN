AB The Ugandan government is committed to scaling-up proven HIV prevention strategies including safe male circumcision, and innovative strategies are needed to increase circumcision uptake. The aim of this study was to assess the acceptability and feasibility of implementing a soccer-based intervention ("Make The Cut") among schoolboys in a peri-urban district of Uganda. The intervention was led by trained, recently circumcised "coaches" who facilitated a 60-minute session delivered in schools, including an interactive penalty shoot-out game using metaphors for HIV prevention, sharing of the coaches' circumcision story, group discussion and ongoing engagement from the coach to facilitate linkage to male circumcision. The study took place in four secondary schools in Entebbe sub-district, Uganda. Acceptability of safe male circumcision was assessed through a cross-sectional quantitative survey. The feasibility of implementing the intervention was assessed by piloting the intervention in one school, modifying it, and implementing the modified version in a second school. Perceptions of the intervention were assessed with in-depth interviews with participants. Of the 210 boys in the cross-sectional survey, 59% reported being circumcised. Findings showed high levels of knowledge and generally favourable perceptions of circumcision. The initial implementation of Make The Cut resulted in 6/58 uncircumcised boys (10.3%) becoming circumcised. Changes made included increasing engagement with parents and improved liaison with schools regarding the timing of the intervention. Following this, uptake improved to 18/69 (26.1%) in the second school. In-depth interviews highlighted the important role of family and peer support and the coach in facilitating the decision to circumcise. This study showed that the modified Make The Cut intervention may be effective to increase uptake of safe male circumcision in this population. However, the intervention is time-intensive, and further work is needed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention conducted at scale.

TI Functional Topology of Evolving Urban Drainage Networks

AB We investigated the scaling and topology of engineered urban drainage networks (UDNs) in two cities, and further examined UDN evolution over decades. UDN scaling was analyzed using two power law scaling characteristics widely employed for river networks: (1) Hack's law of length (L)-area (A) [L alpha A(h)] and (2) exceedance probability distribution of upstream contributing area (delta) [P(A >= delta) similar to a delta(-epsilon)]. For the smallest UDNs (< 2 km(2)), length-area scales linearly (h similar to 1), but power law scaling (h similar to 0.6) emerges as the UDNs grow. While P(A >= delta) plots for river networks are abruptly truncated, those for UDNs display exponential tempering [P(A >= delta) = a delta(-epsilon) exp (-c delta) ]. The tempering parameter c decreases as the UDNs grow, implying that the distribution evolves in time to resemble those for river networks. However, the power law exponent E for large UDNs tends to be greater than the range reported for river networks. Differences in generative processes and engineering design constraints contribute to observed differences in the evolution of UDNs and river networks, including subnet heterogeneity and nonrandom branching.
   Plain Language Summary We show that urban drainage networks (UDNs) evolve to the state topologically similar to rivers: UDNs exhibit self-similarity as they grow beyond a small threshold size, like river networks. We present the gradual emergence of two power laws for UDNs - Hack's law and the size distribution - during decadal growth of two distinct cities. Although an initial UDN reflects the strong influence of engineering design, expanding UDN along with urban growth leads to a scale-invariant topology. The power laws emerge during growth with exponents similar to those seen for rivers. The inevitability of the self-similar topology has significant implications for managing urban drainage infrastructure in the rapidly urbanizing world, with increasing demands on reliable provision of critical services to growing populations.

AB Leveraging multiple simultaneous small cell connections is an emerging and promising solution to enhance session continuity in millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular systems that suffer from frequent link interruptions due to blockage in ultra-dense urban deployments. However, the available performance benefits of feasible multi-connectivity strategies as well as the tentative service quality gains that they promise remain an open research question. Addressing it requires the development of a novel performance evaluation methodology, which should consider: 1) the intricacies of mmWave radio propagation in realistic urban environments; 2) the dynamic mmWave link blockage due to human mobility; and 3) the multi-connectivity network behavior to preserve session continuity. In this paper, we construct this much needed methodology by combining the methods from queuing theory, stochastic geometry, as well as ray-based and system-level simulations. With this integrated framework, both user-and network-centric performance indicators together with their underlying scaling laws can be quantified in representative mmWave scenarios. To ensure modeling accuracy, the components of our methodology are carefully cross verified and calibrated against the current considerations in the standards. Building on this, a thorough comparison of alternative multi-connectivity strategies is conducted, as this paper reveals that even simpler multi-connectivity schemes bring notable improvements to session-level mmWave operation in realistic environments. These findings may become an important reference point for subsequent standardization in this area.

AB One of the most common relativization techniques in life sciences quantifies body condition based on residuals from the linear regression in the log-log plot of body mass against a linear measure of size. Given the network-based analogy between organisms and cities, the method is applied to comparative urban studies to formulate relativized allometric measures based on the allometry to size of metric and topological measures of street networks. The analysis of a sample of 70 cities from a confined region considered in three historical stages demonstrates that the more allometric scaling of a measure to size diverges from the linear, the more allometric measures show discrepancy to the existing relativization methods that are based on mean measures and ratios between measures. Allometric measures reflect the dynamics of specific regional samples of cities and therefore also differ from relativization methods that relate measures that grow exponentially with size against static theoretical yardsticks. The comparison involving two additional samples of cities from other regions suggests that the proposed allometric measures can be used to approximate size-invariant measures for cities with unknown allometry more reliably than existing relativization measures. The method can be applied to formulate relativized indices for any measure that displays allometry to size in various scales of the built environment.

AB Introduction: Rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the context of financial and health system constraints has resulted in calls to maximize efficiency in ART service delivery. Adopting differentiated care models (DCMs) for ART could potentially be more cost-efficient and improve outcomes. However, no study comprehensively projects the cost savings across countries. We model the potential reduction in facility-level costs and number of health workers needed when implementing two types of DCMs while attempting to reach 90-90-90 targets in 38 sub-Saharan African countries from 2016 to 2020.
   Methods: We estimated the costs of three service delivery models: (1) undifferentiated care, (2) differentiated care by patient age and stability, and (3) differentiated care by patient age, stability, key vs. general population status, and urban vs. rural location. Frequency of facility visits, type and frequency of laboratory testing, and coverage of community ART support vary by patient subgroup. For each model, we estimated the total costs of antiretroviral drugs, laboratory commodities, and facility-level personnel and overhead. Certain groups under four-criteria differentiation require more intensive inputs. Community-based ART costs were included in the DCMs. We take into account underlying uncertainty in the projected numbers on ART and unit costs.
   Results: Total five-year facility-based ART costs for undifferentiated care are estimated to be US$23.33 billion (95% confidence interval [CI]: $23.3-$23.5 billion). An estimated 17.5% (95% CI: 17.4%-17.7%) and 16.8% (95% CI: 16.7%-17.0%) could be saved from 2016 to 2020 from implementing the age and stability DCM and four-criteria DCM, respectively, with annual cost savings increasing over time. DCMs decrease the full-time equivalent (FTE) health workforce requirements for ART. An estimated 46.4% (95% CI: 46.1%-46.7%) fewer FTE health workers are needed in 2020 for the age and stability DCM compared with undifferentiated care.
   Conclusions: Adopting DCMs can result in significant efficiency gains in terms of reduced costs and health workforce needs, even with the costs of scaling up community-based ART support under DCMs. Efficiency gains remained flat with increased differentiation. More evidence is needed on how to translate analyzed efficiency gains into implemented cost reductions at the facility level.
