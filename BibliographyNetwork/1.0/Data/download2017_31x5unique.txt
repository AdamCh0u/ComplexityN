AB Objective: To investigate Ontario dentists' perceptions of patient interest in sedation and general anesthesia (GA) during treatment and patient fear and avoidance of dental treatment.
   Methods: Using the Royal College of Dental Surgeons of Ontario roster, we randomly selected 3001 practising Ontario dentists, from among those who listed an email address, to complete a 16-question survey by mail or online. Demographic information (e.g., gender, size and type of primary practice, and years of experience) was collected as well as dentist reports of patient interest in sedation/GA and level of fear regarding treatment. Analysis included sample t-tests to compare Ontario dentist responses with patient responses to a 2002 national survey.
   Results: 1076 dentists participated (37.9% response rate), comprised of 69.7% males, 84.4% general practitioners, 0.5-42 years of practice (mean 20.6 years), and 40.6% from cities with a population larger than 500,000. Dentists underestimated patients' interest in sedation/GA, with dentists and patients reporting patients "Not interested" as 66.8% and 43.9%, respectively, and "Interested depending on cost," 19.8% v. 42.3%. Dentists also underestimated patient interest in sedation/GA for specific dental procedures including scaling, fillings/crowns, root canal therapy and periodontal surgery (p < 0.01). Dentists overestimated patient fear levels ("Somewhat afraid," 19.9% v. 9.8%; "Very afraid," 10.6% v. 2.0%; "Terrified," 6.0% v. 3.5%) and the proportion of patients avoiding dental care (13.3% v. 7.6%).
   Conclusion: Dentists underestimate patients' preference for sedation/GA and overestimate their fear and avoidance of dental care. The significant disparities between the views of dentists and patients may affect the availability and provision of sedation and general anesthesia in Ontario dental practices.

AB Bioelectrochemical hydrogen production has been successfully achieved in laboratory-scale conditions with different substrates. However, scaling up microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) is not straightforward, and reported attempts have not been completely successful. This work presents the design, building, start-up and operation of an MEC pilot plant (130 L) based on a cassette configuration. The plant was started up in batch mode with acetate and glucose as substrates and operated for five months with different substrates (i.e. glucose, diluted raw glycerol and real urban wastewater). The best results were obtained in the last period with primary effluent from real urban wastewater. The hydrogen production increased to values higher than 4 L d(-1) with a gas purity of 95%, a cathodic gas recovery of 82% and an energy recovery of 121% with respect to the electrical input. The organic matter removal efficiency was approximately 25% for a hydraulic retention time of 2 d with an organic loading rate (OLR) of 0.25 gCOD.L-1.d(-1). It should be possible to achieve removal efficiencies around 75% with OLR5 lower than 0.05 gCOD.L-1.d(-1). These results are promising and represent an important step towards the industrial implementation of these systems. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI PLANETARY BOUNDARY LAYER HEIGHT MEASURED BY A WIND PROFILER BASED ON THE
   WAVELET TRANSFORM
SO JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY

AB Planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is an important input parameter for any boundary layer study or model, either climate or atmospheric. The variation of the PBLH is also of great significance to the physical processes of numerical prediction, diagnosis of weather forecasting and monitoring urban pollutants. However, effective ways to monitor the PBLH continuously are lack. Wind profilers are commonly used in monitoring PBLH continuously because of its high temporal and spatial resolution, coupled with capability of continuous detection. In this paper, the covariance wavelet transform (CWT) is used to analyze the range-corrected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the wind profiler to determine the PBLH, which is then compared with the results measured by the gradient method and the radiosonde. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The scaling parameter a and translation parameter b of the wavelet are critical in determination of the PBLH by applying the CWT as different values may get completely different results, which requires to select appropriate values in the calculation carefully. (2) Quality control is crucial in determining the PBLH because good quality control can help remove mutation points, which makes the determined PBLH more consistent with the actual situation. (3) In clear-air, the gradient method is not applicable if the boundary layer turbulence is inhomogeneous and the impact of noise is large for that it is easy to be impacted by the mutation of SNR caused by the atmosphere turbulence instability and other factors, which will cause large errors, while the CWT method as an improvement of the gradient method can determine the PBLH quite well. (4) Through quality control, the PBLHs determined by the CWT are consistent with those of radiosonde, and the correlation coefficient between them is 0.87.

AB The study aims at investigating the effect of second language (L2) exposure environment on NNESTs' teaching skills and beliefs about EFL learning beyond the classroom. This is a survey for non-native English speaking teachers (NNESTs) of Indonesian Senior High Schools (or in Indonesian terms 'SMA') from different L2 environments, namely: 1) urban-region exposure environment schools (n=40), and 2) rural-region exposure environment schools (n=40). There were two instruments used in the present study, i.e. 1) observation scaling checklist, and 2) questionnaire. The observation scaling checklist was used for assessing the respondents' performance when they were teaching in class. Meanwhile, the questionnaire using a four-point Likert scale was used to elicit data. The researchers used a series of independent t-test to analyze the data. The result reveals that: 1) there is a significant difference between teaching skills of NNESTs from the urban region schools and those of NNESTs from rural region schools, t (78)= 19.499, p=0.000; and 2) there is a significant difference between beliefs about English as a foreign language (EFL learning beyond the classroom of the NNESTs from urban region schools and those of NNESTs from rural region schools, t (78)= - 4.925, p=0.000

AB In many cities, pilot projects are set up to test new technologies that help to address urban sustainability issues, improve the effectiveness of urban services, and enhance the quality of life of citizens. These projects, often labelled as smart city projects, are typically supported by municipalities, funded by subsidies, and run in partnerships. Many of the projects fade out after the pilot stage, and fail to generate scalable solutions that contribute to sustainable urban development. The lack of scaling is widely perceived as a major problem. In this paper, we analyze processes of upscaling, focusing on smart city pilot projects in which several partnerswith different missions, agendas, and incentivesjoin up. We start with a literature review, in which we identify three types of upscaling: roll-out, expansion, and replication, each with its own dynamics and degree of context sensitivity. The typology is further specified in relation to several conditions and requirements that can impact upscaling processes, and illustrated by a descriptive analysis of three smart city pilot projects developed in Amsterdam. The paper ends with conclusions and recommendations on pilot projects and partnership governance, and adds new perspectives on the debate regarding upscaling.
