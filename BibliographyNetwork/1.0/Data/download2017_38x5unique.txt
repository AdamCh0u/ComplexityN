AB Between 2009 and 2013, the EAU&3E research program gathered several French research teams and water utilities, with the aim to provide a scientific answer to the following question: are our water services sustainable, even in the heart of Europe? The goal of this project was develop knowledge and improve methods to achieve a sustainable management for water services. Our ambition was to go beyond the separate analysis of each dimension of sustainable development (economic, social, environmental): in parallel and together, we tried to add knowledge on 4 major dimensions (namely: environment, economics, equity and governance), applied to a set of empirical case studies in France and in other OECD countries. We specifically focused on: a) the recent decline in water consumption and its feedbacks with water tariffs and water utilities' financial balance; b) the long term asset management issue, related to the necessary renewal of aging water infrastructures; c) the redistributive effects, including growing water poverty due to counter-intuitive effects of water tariffs; d) the new territorial scaling options for water service management (up-scaling, downscaling, technology mix), including multi-level governance to improve the resilience of urban water supply and to foster the participation of water users. Lastly, we synthesized our findings in a set of scenarios on upcoming possibilities for future water service management in European cities. Forecasting offers many interesting tools to support water services authorities and operating companies in its decisions and to better apprehend the sustainable/unsustainable paths for its future. In this paper we focus on large cities in France (Paris) and Spain (Madrid and Barcelona).

AB Urban area expansion is happening at much faster rates in Asian and African cities than elsewhere in the world. This study uses multi-temporal Landsat images to map the urban extent of six small to large cities in West Africa at four different time steps from the early 1970s-2010. The selected cities are Kumasi of Ghana, Daloa of Cote d'Ivoire, Abuja and Kano in Nigeria, Kindia of Guinea, and Ouagadougou of Burkina Faso. All cities revealed significant urban growth in both urban area and population; however, it was apparent that there was a lot of variability in urban area development. Exponential urban growth rates in the cities were measured as ranging between 0.026 and 0.077, with allometric scaling factors matching those of other countries.

AB Background: Evidence-based approaches are requisite in evaluating public health programmes. Nowhere are they more necessary than physical activity interventions where evidence of effectiveness is often poor, especially within hard to reach groups. Our study reports on the quality of the evaluation of a government funded walking programme in five 'Walking Cities' in England. Cities were required to undertake a simple but robust evaluation using the Standard Evaluation Framework (SEF) for physical activity interventions to enable high quality, consistent evaluation. Our aim was not to evaluate the outcomes of this programme but to evaluate whether the evaluation process had been effective in generating new and reliable evidence on intervention design and what had worked in 'real world' circumstances.
   Methods: Funding applications and final reports produced by the funder and the five walking cities were obtained. These totalled 16 documents which were systematically analysed against the 52 criteria in the SEF. Data were cross checked between the documents at the bid and reporting stage with reference to the SEF guidance notes.
   Results: Generally, the SEF reporting requirements were not followed well. The rationale for the interventions was badly described, the target population was not precisely specified, and neither was the method of recruitment. Demographics of individual participants, including socio-economic status were reported poorly, despite being a key criterion for funding.
   Conclusions: Our study of the evaluations demonstrated a missed opportunity to confidently establish what worked and what did not work in walking programmes with particular populations. This limited the potential for evidence synthesis and to highlight innovative practice warranting further investigation. Our findings suggest a mandate for evaluability assessment. Used at the planning stage this may have ensured the development of realistic objectives and crucially may have identified innovative practice to implement and evaluate. Logic models may also have helped in the development of the intervention and its means of capturing evidence prior to implementation. It may be that research-practice partnerships between universities and practitioners could enhance this process. A lack of conceptual clarity means that replicability and scaling-up of effective interventions is difficult and the opportunity to learn from failure lost.

AB The capacity of adaptation is essential elements towards urban resilience. One adaptation that can be done is to consider the provision of open space and public space in the city. Yogyakarta City development which focused on the built area and negates the open space has blurred the characteristics of the city. Efforts in increasing the availability of public space is one of the seven priorities of the programs included in the environmental and the utilization of space in Yogyakarta City. An understanding of the provision of public green open spaces in Yogyakarta is important because the products and processes that take place in a development will determine the successful implementation of the development plan. The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) to identify the provision green space in Yogyakarta City from the aspects of product and procedure; and (2) to identify the role of green space to build resilient city. This study is used descriptive qualitative approach with in-depth interview, literature review, and triangulation as the method for data collection. Yogyakarta has had instruments for public green open spaces provision called Masterplan Ruang Terbuka Hijau (RTH) Up-Scaling Yogyakarta 2013-2032 which govern the typologies and criteria for green open space development in the city. Public green open spaces development mechanism can be grouped into the planning phase, the utilization phase, and the control phase of each consisting of legal and regulatory aspects, institutional aspects, financial aspects, and technical aspects. The mechanism of green open space provision should regard the need of advocacy for "urban green commons" (UGCs) development as a systematic approach of collective-participatory for urban land management.

AB Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) language models are powerful models that can incorporate linguistic and non-linguistic contextual signals in a unified framework with a convex loss. MaxEnt models also have the advantage of scaling to large model and training data sizes We present the following two contributions to MaxEnt training: (1) By leveraging smaller amounts of transcribed data, we demonstrate that a MaxEnt LM trained on various types of corpora can be easily adapted to better match the test distribution of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR); (2) A novel adaptive-training approach that efficiently models multiple types of non-linguistic features in a universal model. We evaluate the impact of these approaches on Google's state-of-the-art ASR for the task of voice-search transcription and dictation. Training 10B parameter models utilizing a corpus of up to IT words, we show large reductions in word error rate from adaptation across multiple languages. Also, human evaluations show significant improvements on a wide range of domains from using non-linguistic features. For example, adapting to geographical domains (e.g., US States and cities) affects about 4% of test utterances, with 2: 1 win to loss ratio.
