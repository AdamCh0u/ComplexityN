AB Adaptive cloud elasticity is a key requirement and an open challenge for the cost-effective and performance-efficient allocation of resources for cloud-based applications. It becomes even more challenging for IoT applications due to the dynamic and unpredictable characteristics of IoT data including volume, velocity, variety, volatility, and heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the impact of varying velocity and volume of IoT data streams on (a) the performance of the data ingestion and storage process, and (b) the corresponding cloud resource utilization. We use the open-source OpenIoT platform as our test bed and run experiments under different data streaming settings. We study the throughput and error rate, as well as CPU and memory consumption during the ingestion process. Experimental results reveal some interesting insights into the performance of OpenIoT and allow us to draw more general observations for cloud-based IoT platforms, including (a) resource availability is not the only factor influencing performance of the data ingestion process, with the middleware and software components having significant impact, (b) allocating extra resources at the infrastructure layer of the IoT platform can potentially improve the performance of the data ingestion process, but may lead to resource wastage, and (c) adaptive scaling out/in using small sized compute units can significantly improve resource utilization while ensuring quality-assured data delivery. Based on these insights, we identify two key future research directions for quality-assured data delivery in cloud-based IoT platforms including adaptive resource optimization at the infrastructure layer and component configuration optimization and/or upgradation at the middleware layer.

AB In contrast to applications relying on specialized and expensive highly-available infrastructure, the basic approach of microservice architectures to achieve fault tolerance - and finally high availability - is to modularize the software system into small, self-contained services that are connected via implementation-independent interfaces. Microservices and all dependencies are deployed into self-contained environments called containers that are executed as multiple redundant instances. If a service fails, other instances will often still work and take over. Due to the possibility of failing infrastructure, these services have to be deployed on several physical systems. This horizontal scaling of redundant service instances can also be used for load-balancing. Decoupling the service communication using asynchronous message queues can increase fault tolerance, too. The Deutsche Bahn AG (German railway company) uses as system called EPA for seat reservations for inter-urban rail services. Despite its high availability, the EPA system in its current state has several disadvantages such as high operational cost, need for special hardware, technological dependencies, and expensive and time-consuming updates. With the help of a prototype, we evaluate the general properties of a microservice architecture and its dependability with reference to the legacy system. We focus on requirements for an equivalent microservice-based system and the migration process; services and data, containerization, communication via message queues; and achieving similar fault tolerance and high availability with the help of replication inside the resulting architecture.

AB In 2011, the newly elected Seoul Mayor introduced administrative reforms that breathed new life into a series of grassroots initiatives. High-profile reforms helped strengthen the connection between Seoul's government, environment, and citizenry and the collection of reforms spurred changes that were pivotal to reorienting Seoul development trajectory. This article draws upon sustainability transitions literature to trace process enabling this reorientation. It highlights the critical role played by change agents such as Seoul Mayor in working at the boundary of 'regimes' and 'niches' to enable wider scale change; while citizen engagement can broaden grassroots innovation's impacts. It further underscores how key enablers in the transitions process can help scale changes to and within regime level. The paper, however, draws a subtle but under-examined distinction between organizational and institutional change within the regime level. This within-level distinction could be the difference between a sustainability transitions that changes Seoul as well as other cities in the future. (c) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This paper investigates alternative ways to construct a decision tool intended to help the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) region to meet or exceed the goal of 80% reduction in the emission of Green House Gas (GHG) by 2050. The goal is to explore and build several preprototypes to evaluate the value of the role for ABM, alternative data sources (Census, energy reports, DVRPC surveys, etc.), GIS modeling, and various social science theories of human behavior (land value theory, economic disparity theory, cognitive learning theory, etc.). Section 2 presents a model of the business as usual scenario that uses trend extrapolation to project energy consumption and GHG production until 2050. Section 3 then explains initial research on an Agent Based Model (ABM) with which users can investigate the role of attitude, information awareness, and economic disparities upon consumer choice of residence location and transportation mode. Finally, we conclude with some lessons learned and challenges for scaling.

TI The scaling of crime concentration in cities
SO PLOS ONE

ID SIZE; GROWTH; CITY; LAWS
AB Crime is a major threat to society's well-being but lacks a statistical characterization that could lead to uncovering some of its underlying mechanisms. Evidence of nonlinear scaling of urban indicators in cities, such as wages and serious crime, has motivated the understanding of cities as complex systems-a perspective that offers insights into resources limits and sustainability, but that usually neglects details of the indicators themselves. Notably, since the nineteenth century, criminal activities have been known to occur unevenly within a city; crime concentrates in such way that most of the offenses take place in few regions of the city. Though confirmed by different studies, this concentration lacks broad analyses on its characteristics, which hinders not only the comprehension of crime dynamics but also the proposal of sounding counter-measures. Here, we developed a framework to characterize crime concentration which divides cities into regions with the same population size. We used disaggregated criminal data from 25 locations in the U.S. and the U.K., spanning from 2 to 15 years of longitudinal data. Our results confirmed that crime concentrates regardless of city and revealed that the level of concentration does not scale with city size. We found that the distribution of crime in a city can be approximated by a power-law distribution with exponent a that depends on the type of crime. In particular, our results showed that thefts tend to concentrate more than robberies, and robberies more than burglaries. Though criminal activities present regularities of concentration, we found that criminal ranks have the tendency to change continuously over time-features that support the perspective of crime as a complex system and demand analyses and evolving urban policies covering the city as a whole.
