AB This paper investigates the persistency properties of ozone concentrations at eight selected air quality monitoring stations situated in uban and suburban area of Peninsular Malaysia. Daily maximum hourly data of ozone concentration in 19982009, is used in this study. In describing the persistency, the scaling analysis, namely Detrended Moving Median (DMM) method was used to estimate the degree of persistency, known as Hurst estimator, H. This method is the adaptation of the Detrended Moving Average (DMA) method. The finding showed that there are three different scaling regions separated by a critical time scale, n(c1) and n(c2) which is around 8 month and 2 years. For shorter time scale ( n < n(c1)) and larger time scale (n > n(c2)), the ozone concentration are persist and it remain high which the H values are showed between 0.5 < H < 1 for the most of monitoring stations in urban area. While, in suburban area, the persistency of ozone concentration are as similar as result for urban area. But a weakly persistency of ozone concentration are seen on a middle time scale (n(c1) < n < n(c2)). Therefore, these findings provide scaling behaviour and persistence in ozone concentration in the ambient air in urban and suburban area of Peninsular Malaysia.

AB Persistence and extinction are key processes in infectious disease dynamics that, owing to incomplete reporting, are seldom directly observable. For fully immunizing diseases, reporting probabilities can be readily estimated from demographic records and case reports. Yet reporting probabilities are not sufficient to unambiguously reconstruct disease incidence from case reports. Here, we focus on disease presence (i.e. marginal probability of non-zero incidence), which provides an upper bound on the marginal probability of disease extinction. We examine measles and pertussis in pre-vaccine era United States (US) cities, and describe a conserved scaling relationship between population size, reporting probability and observed presence (i.e. non-zero case reports). We use this relationship to estimate disease presence given perfect reporting, and define cryptic presence as the difference between estimated and observed presence. We estimate that, in early twentieth century US cities, pertussis presence was higher than measles presence across a range of population sizes, and that cryptic presence was common in small cities with imperfect reporting. While the methods employed here are specific to fully immunizing diseases, our results suggest that cryptic incidence deserves careful attention, particularly in diseases with low case counts, poor reporting and longer infectious periods.

DE LTE; outdoor positioning; UE RSRP difference; MDS
AB Currently, with the rapid development of 4G, most urban outdoor areas have been well covered with LTE signal, which provides the possibility to use LTE on land for positioning navigation system as a substitute of global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Because of cost and implementation difficulty, Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) was proposed in LTE Release 10. It utilizes the LTE user equipment to feedback the measurement report of reference signal receiving power (RSRP) for the network optimization, which makes the LTE fingerprint based positioning system possible. However, due to the mobile diversity, user habit and complicated channel, the user equipment (UE) RSRP difference is a non-ignorable problem that affects the positioning accuracy both in the online phase and offline phase. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an UE RSRP difference elimination method based on Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm. By using the relative RSRP difference between each two mobile terminals, we eliminate the RSRP difference both in the offline phase and online phase. We implemented the proposed method in a dense urban area and evaluated its performance. The experiment results indicated that the proposed method could effectively eliminate the UE RSRP difference and improve the positioning accuracy for LTE fingerprint-based positioning system.

AB 1. The architecture of trees is the result of constrained, morphologically plastic growth constrained by an underlying architectural model embedded in their genome, the structure of which can be significantly altered during growth to match the changing environmental conditions to which the tree is exposed. Here, we examined the hypothesis that crowding from neighbours should cause trees to optimize traits for light competition at the expense of wind resistance, with the reverse being true for trees lacking neighbours. Previous studies have examined the influence of light competition or wind resistance on shaping tree architecture, but few, if any, have simultaneously addressed trade-offs for optimizing these traits in response to crowding from neighbouring trees in forests, as compared to open-grown conditions.
   2. We studied the response of tree-and branch-level architectural traits of temperate, broad-leaved, deciduous tree species of differing shade tolerance and wood strength from multiple locations across the north-eastern United States. Trees ranged in size (4-83 cm diameter at 1.3 m) and crowding conditions (open-and forest-grown) and occupied different canopy positions. The open-grown trees represented a null condition, where the lack of neighbouring trees to shape architectural traits could be contrasted with the influence of different levels of crowding in forests.
   3. Our results show strong evidence for a tree neighbourhood-induced convergence of architectural traits across species and conditions, even when trees are growing in urban rather than natural forest conditions. After accounting for crowding, the effects of species and sample location contributed very little to explaining variation in architectural traits. One exception was crown dimensions, for which species-specific differences explained about 15% of the residual variation.
   4. Under open-grown conditions, alleviation of light competition caused trees to develop relatively large crowns and branches and a squat growth form suitable to resist greater wind exposure. By contrast, increasing shading from neighbouring trees caused forest-grown trees to become increasingly more spindly in the main stem, with slender branches sparsely distributed over a disproportionately large crown volume - presumably to maximize light capture. Although the latter is an intrinsically less wind-stable form, it can be adopted to increase light capture because neighbouring trees reduce exposure to the wind, which should greatly reduce the likelihood of stem breakage or uprooting under critical wind pressures.

AB The Model for External Reliance of Localities in (MERLIN) Coastal Management Zones is a proposed solution to allow scaling of variables to smaller, nested geographies. Using a principal components analysis and data normalization techniques, smaller scale data relationships are linked to data relationships within larger geographies and scaling factors are developed for each. In using these relationships, MERLIN will derive a set of variables scaled to a desired geography representing the attributes of the population present. The concept driving MERLIN's development is that correlations between variables at a specific location and level of geography can be tested and applied to other scales for interpolations. This flexibility and relative simplicity of calculation make MERLIN a valuable tool in many types of social research and for data interpolation. In a pilot study, the MERLIN model is applied to counties along the Gulf Coast of Florida to create a well-being index at the census tract level. Results reveal a landscape that better accounts for the localized patterns of values situated within a larger geographic unit.
