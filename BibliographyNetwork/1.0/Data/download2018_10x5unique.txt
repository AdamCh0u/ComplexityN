AB The historical urban tissues are the rich sources of social culture history; so need to be revitalized because of "obsolescence" process during the ages and it is quiet natural. Rather than the characteristics of the historical tissue must be updated to meet the contemporary human needs by "integrated revitalization". This method known as a staged process which followed planned mechanism. Beside of all of this integrated revitalization based on maintaining natural capital for present and future generation which is known as "Sustainability". The main aim of this paper is to propose a model for integrating the two concept of sustainability and revitalization of historic urban quarters and to indicate an appropriate strategy for their revitalization. Based on this aim, this study use analytical-descriptive method according to documents and theoretical framework. So this study is based on several stages: first presents the theoretical review on the concept of "revitalization", and its relationship with sustainability; next, it introduces the characteristics, role, selection process and scaling method of sustainability in compare with revitalization. The paper then, as the main contribution of this paper, proposes the model for measuring the level of sustainability in historic urban quarters and determines some proposals to achieve revitalized and sustainable historic urban quarters. Therefore, when the level of sustainability is high in any one of these three structures, it means that the level of obsolescence is low in the same structures of an historic urban quarter. The result of this paper leads us to say that, the level of sustainability is a new (additional) input in the strategic planning process of revitalization and sustainable urban revitalization of historic urban quarters. Finally, the paper concludes with a brief summary on the general arguments of the paper. As aforementioned, there are three strategic approaches in the revitalization process. Accordingly, there will be three proposals according to the level and types of obsolescence, sustainability and development dynamics in order to achieve more sustainable historic urban quarters. The first strategic approach is determined by whether the area has a high resource value with physical obsolescence, high development dynamics and a high sustainability level. The possibility of high development dynamics, which are accepted as an historic urban quarter is still an attractive proposition for its current use and/or for alternative uses. In respect of these results, an historic urban quarter, where physical obsolescence and high development dynamics is present, it is necessary to implement physical revitalization as a short-term strategy and functional regeneration as a long-term strategy. In the second proposal, the strategic approach is applied when an historic urban quarter has only a partially sustainable position due to the presence of physical and functional obsolescence in the physical structures and problems in the socio-economic structure. If an historic urban quarter has physical and functional obsolescence, the development dynamics are in a static state. According to these results, the proposal should be to implement physical revitalization as a short-term strategy and functional diversification as a long-term economic revitalization strategy to increase the attractiveness and sustainability level of historic urban quarters.
   The third proposal is applied when an historic urban quarter is in an unsustainable condition and demonstrates a high degree of physical, functional and locational obsolescence. If an historic urban quarter has these three types of obsolescence, the development dynamics are in a declining and/or deteriorating state.

AB This paper introduces a unified, scalable and replicable approach to make implementation of the autonomous system on a new vehicle faster while preserving its autonomous performance. The main idea of this approach is to create a standard hardware architecture, along with a Simulink or similar library and templates for autonomous driving for a unified approach to vehicle autonomy, making it easier to scale the solution and replicate it on other vehicle platforms. However, this scaling and replicating of the autonomous driving system between vehicles remains difficult especially for low-level controller design due to parametric difference between vehicles. This paper, hence, demonstrates a sequential controller design procedure with specific example of lateral control for a chosen vehicle. The same design process can be replicated to adapt controller parameters for other vehicles. The parameter space approach is applied here to ensure robust path following performance of a proportional-derivative (PD) steering controller, considering uncertainties of vehicle load, speed and tire cornering stiffness. To further reduce the tracking error and handle unmodeled dynamics and reject disturbances, a model regulator was added based on overall system analysis. To evaluate the control strategy, a validated high-fidelity model of an autonomous research vehicle is used within a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation environment. Soft sensors were also connected to the soft automated vehicle in the HIL environment to test high-level control and decision making mechanisms. The road used for the simulations is a replica of a designated real world short AV pilot route in the Ohio State University West campus. Traffic is generated with Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software in order to analyze the problems due to the presence of other vehicles and evaluate performance more realistically in the HIL simulator.

AB To better understand the trends shaping the future of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the Futures Research methodology of Environmental Scanning was deployed. This basically involves scanning both published and unpublished literature to identify key trends. Then a deep dive on the identified trends through further reviews of materials including research papers, news items, blogs etc. and interviews with experts in the area. Data was then analyzed and synthesized to produce trends monitoring reports and policy briefs over the course of one year. The trends synthesized to identify megatrends and potential impacts, as well as potential innovations being used to mitigate key challenges and take advantage of emerging opportunities.
   The four key themes/trends identified were: Securing Wheat Availability for North Africa; The Future of Millennials in North Africa; Managing Water Scarcity in North Africa; and Future of North Africa's Slums. While these trends were found to pose serious concerns for the future of the region, there were many innovations and policy options identified that have potential to mitigate the impacts. Public-private partnership was found to be a key way forward in further scaling the innovations identified. Therefore, inclusive business approaches are key to a better future and policies to encourage such practices are needed. Our research also identified important innovations in the area of policy e.g. providing loans and subsidies to urban users so that they can retrofit home appliance to better conserve water. The key message is that the future of the region will depend on understanding key drivers of the future, catalyzing innovations to address future challenges and opportunities, and also mobilizing private sector in more cooperative public-private ventures. Trends and potential innovations identified provide both governments and development partners with points of leverage in shaping a better future for the region.

AB Objective To investigate multicontaminant air pollution in Chinese cities, to quantify the urban population affected and to explore the relationship between air pollution and urban population size.
   Methods We obtained data for 155 cities with 276 million inhabitants for 2014from China's air quality monitoring networkon concentrations of fine particulate matter measuring under 25 mu m (PM2.5),coarse particulate matter measuring 2.5 to 10 mu m (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O-3). Concentrations were considered as high, if they exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guideline limits.
   Findings Overall, 51% (142 million) of the study population was exposed to mean annual multicontaminant concentrations above WHO limits - east China and the megacities were worst affected. High daily levels of four-contaminant mixtures of PM2.5, PK10, SO2 and O-3 and PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 occurred on up to 110 days in 2014 in many cities, mainly in Shandong and Hebei Provinces. High daily levels of PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 occurred on over 146 days in 110 cities, mainly in east and central China. High daily levels of mixtures of PM(2.5)and PM10, PM2.5 and SO2, and PM10 and SO2 occurred on over 146 days in 145 cities, mainly in east China. Surprisingly, multicontaminant air pollution was less frequent in cities with populations over 10 million than in smaller cities.
   Conclusion Multicontaminant air pollution was common in Chinese cities. A shift from single-conta minant to multicontaminant evaluations of the health effects of air pollution is needed. China should implement protective measures during future urbanization.

AB Multifractal theory provides a new spatial analytical tool for urban studies, but many basic problems remain to be solved. Among various pending issues, the most significant one is how to obtain proper multifractal dimension spectrums. If an algorithm is improperly used, the parameter spectrums will be abnormal. This paper is devoted to investigating two ordinary least squares (OLS)-based approaches for estimating urban multifractal parameters. Using empirical study and comparative analysis, we demonstrate how to utilize the adequate linear regression to calculate multifractal parameters. The OLS regression analysis has two different approaches. One is that the intercept is fixed to zero, and the other is that the intercept is not limited. The results of comparative study show that the zero-intercept regression yields proper multifractal parameter spectrums within certain scale range of moment order, while the common regression method often leads to abnormal multifractal parameter values. A conclusion can be reached that fixing the intercept to zero is a more advisable regression method for multifractal parameters estimation, and the shapes of spectral curves and value ranges of fractal parameters can be employed to diagnose urban problems. This research is helpful for scientists to understand multifractal models and apply a more reasonable technique to multifractal parameter calculations.
