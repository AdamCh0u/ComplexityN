AB Emissions from road transport are routinely prepared at the national scale in many countries under different national and international policies, directives and legislation. Scaling down this emission to the smaller geographical area is considered as a top-down approach. Several methods have been previously applied to scaling down emission, however these have often reported inconsistent findings in comparison with emission distribution using a bottom-up approach. Carbon dioxide and particulate matter (smaller than about 2.5 mu m) emissions from a national road transport estimation in Ireland were dis-aggregated among four counties in the Greater Dublin Area and subsequently distributed at a finer spatial scale (0.5 x 0.5 km(2)). Spatial coverage of the proxy variables, spatial weight distribution and appropriate representation of the fleet characteristics were identified as main sources of difference in distributed spatial emissions between top-down and bottom-up approaches. The first two issues were addressed in this paper by predicting missing or absent traffic volume from limited datasets, and the later was addressed by considering the fleet and mileage data from national annual vehicle test data at county level. A neural network model was applied to predict traffic volume which showed a 51% precision in prediction performance. Emission distribution was also performed for comparison purposes using a more conventional road density-based approach, where a correlation analysis showed an inconsistency between the two approaches. The results of this study highlighted that if the fleet characteristics at county level were not considered, the estimated emission would be different by -1.6 to -8.6% (Carbon dioxide) and -12.6 to 0.03% (Particulate matter) for passenger cars and -3.57-13.6% (Carbon dioxide) and -0.054-16.8% (Particulate matter) for light and heavy duty vehicles, depending on the counties in question. This study revealed that a share of 22.6% and 21.1% of national carbon dioxide and particulate matter emission occurred in Dublin County alone, and Dublin city was attributed to approximately 10.5% carbon dioxide and 9.8% particulate matter of the national total. The particulate matter in Dublin County was 14.3-22.4% higher than surrounding counties, and carbon dioxide emissions in Dublin city were two times higher than that of the towns and urban areas in the surrounding three counties. This study provides a combination of methods for producing finer scale spatial estimation of emission to facilitate abatement strategies and mitigation action plans at county and municipality level for the reduction of emission, better air quality and climate. The study highlights the necessity of reliable spatial distribution methods for assigning emission at a finer scale. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Urbanization has tremendous impacts on most native species. This is especially true in land snails, which are surprisingly understudied organisms. Due to their low mobility and dispersal potential, land snails are valuable indicators of ecosystem disturbance. For this study, land snails were collected in 54 city parks along an urban gradient to understand impacts of urbanization on snail communities. Sampled parks include small extensively landscaped downtown parks, neighborhood and community parks, district parks, and large nature parks, each with variable vegetation, soil characteristics, disturbance regimes, and human activities. Sampling recovered 12,153 individual snails, representing 20 families, 43 genera, and 95 species. Seven new Tennessee state and 87 new county occurrences were recorded. Five non-native and one extra-limital non-native species were found, four of which are new Tennessee state records. Results show that urbanization greatly alters land snail community structure. Nature and district parks have significantly greater species richness, species diversity and species evenness than community, neighborhood, and downtown parks. Degradation of parks, distance from the park to the commercial city center and percent of coarse woody debris accounted for most of the variation between park types. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and pairwise Jaccard indices indicate that downtown snail communities are more similar whereas snail communities in nature parks are more distinct. This suggests that urbanization promotes homogenization among land snail communities. We also show that this homogenization is thus far driven mainly by synanthropic, broadly adapted native species rather than non-native snail species.

AB Background Countries across sub-Saharan Africa are scaling up Community Health Worker (CHW) programmes, yet there remains little high-quality research assessing strategies for CHW supervision and performance improvement. This randomised controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of a personalised performance dashboard used as a supervision tool on the quantity, speed, and quality of CHW care.
   Methods We conducted a randomised controlled trial in a large health catchment area in peri-urban Mali. One hundred forty-eight CHWs conducting proactive case-finding home visits were randomly allocated to receive individual monthly supervision with or without the CHW Performance Dashboard from January to June 2016. Randomisation was stratified by CHW supervisor, level of CHW experience, and CHW baseline performance for monthly quantity of care (number of household visits). With regression analysis, we used a difference-in-difference model to estimate the effect of the intervention on monthly quantity, timeliness (percentage of children under five treated within 24 hours of symptom onset), and quality (percentage of children under five treated without protocol error) of care over a six-month post-intervention period relative to a three-month pre-intervention period.
   Results Use of the Dashboard during monthly supervision significantly increased the mean number of home visits by 39.94 visits per month (95% CI = 3.56-76.3; P = 0.031). Estimated effects on secondary outcomes of timeliness and quality were positive but not statistically significant. Across both study arms, CHW quantity, timeliness, and quality of care significantly improved over the study period, during which time all CHWs received dedicated monthly supervision, although effects plateaued over time.
   Conclusions Our findings suggest that dedicated monthly supervision and personalised feedback using performance dashboards can increase CHW productivity. Further operational research is needed to understand how to sustain the performance improvements over time.

AB The urgency of climate change and other sustainability challenges makes transferring and scaling solutions between cities a necessity. However, solutions are deeply contextual. To accelerate solution efforts, there is a need to understand how context shapes the development of solutions. Universities are well positioned to work with cities on transferring solutions from and to other cities. This paper analyses five case studies of city-university partnerships in three countries on transferring solutions. Our analysis suggests that understanding the interest, the action on sustainability, and the individual and collective sustainability competences on the part of the city administration and the university can help facilitate the transfer of sustainability solutions across contexts. We conclude that the nature of the city-university partnership is essential to solution transfer and that new and existing networks can be used to accelerate progress on the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

AB The new global agenda, with Agenda 2030 at its core, is ambitious, comprehensive, and universal. The three central goals now are to reignite growth, deliver on the sustainable development goals (SDGs), and meet the ambitions of the Paris climate agreement aimed at mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects. Achieving these goals will require a significant scaling up and reorientation of investments, especially for sustainable infrastructure and human development. Implementing this agenda is urgent, as the world is witnessing the largest wave of urban expansion in history and more infrastructure will come on stream over the next 15 years than the world's existing stock. This is also the last opportunity to manage remaining significant demographic transitions.
   The capital investments and technological choices made in the coming two decades will lock-in carbonization, urbanization, and demographic trends that will determine the future of humanity and our planet for the rest of the century and beyond.
   The backdrop for achieving these ambitions is challenging. In many countries, investment and productivity growth have decelerated, there is growing inequality and persistent unemployment, fragility and tensions are rising, and the incidence and vulnerability to shocks has grown. At the same time, major opportunities exist to tap the potential of new technologies and the growing capacity of the private sector. Today's hyper-connected world requires a mix of activities spanning private goods, national public goods, and regional/global public goods to meet the challenges of sustainable development.
   The agenda requires government intervention to reach adequate scale, to take social and environmental sustainability seriously, and to manage spillovers across sectors and borders. It also requires stepped up international cooperation to drive transformative change and mobilize financing on an unprecedented scale.
   With their highly effective capacity to help countries strengthen policy and institutional foundations and to leverage finance, multilateral development banks (MDBs) have a central role to play. They are trying to respond, but human and financial constraints and unclear and expanded mandates from shareholders are holding them back. Clarifying their mandates and addressing the constraints are essential to enable them to scale up and make more effective their support for the new global agenda.
   The unique financial structure of the MDBs allows them to leverage contributions from MDB shareholders and multiply them into financing at low cost. This financial capacity can in turn further crowd-in other sources of finance, especially from the private sector. With better system-wide coordination, MDBs can scale up their impact to deliver for increasingly differentiated clients, but this requires shareholder consensus on, and financial support for, expanded efforts.
   Independent evaluations suggest that each MDB is individually performing well, but the system as a whole is not delivering enough.
   This paper suggests ways to improve policy and operational coherence among MDBs and outlines how better shareholder governance could bring this about. It focuses on the need for stepped-up financing of investments in developing countries, but should be viewed in the broader context of managing globalization, especially with regard to trade and financial stability.
