AB The goal of this paper is to infer the applicability of scaling concepts to haemovigilance based on the study of the relationship between severe adverse reactions and events (SARE) and blood transfusions (BT). We hypothesize that in a haemovigilance operating optimally, SARE should be a power-law function of BT as SARE = alpha BT beta. We investigated the relationship between yearly BT and the related SARE reported in 12 French hospitals of the Picardie State from 2004 to 2015. First we found that when integrated over the whole period 2004-2015, SARE were significantly described by a power-law function SARE BT1.51 for 10 of the 12 hospitals considered. The numbers of SARE in these two hospitals is drastically over-estimated by this power-law, that is 1.9- to 4.3-fold lower than those predicted by the power-law. When considered on a yearly basis, we consistently found that SARE was also significantly described by a power-law function of the form SARE alpha BT1.44 for 10 of the 12 hospitals considered. In turn, the occurrence of SARE in the two other hospitals was strongly over-estimated by this power-law, though it is also significantly described by another power-law, SARE alpha BT1.11. We specified these results through separate yearly analyses and found the relationship between SARE and BT was best described by a power law with beta = 0.90 in 2004, a linear relationship from 2005 to 2007 and a power-law with beta ranging from 1.49 and 1.92 from 2008 to 2014. Finally, in 2015, the relationship between SARE and BT was significantly described by a power-law SARE alpha BT1.17 for the 12 hospitals considered. Overall, our results suggest that hospitals performing more blood transfusions are more efficient as the observed negative effects of blood transfusions increase relatively slower than in hospitals performing less transfusions.

TI Decades of urban growth and development on the Asian megadeltas
SO GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE
LA English

ID NET PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; DELTAS; ACCURACY; LIGHTS; HUMANS
AB The current and ongoing expansion of urban areas worldwide represents the largest mass migration in human history. It is well known that the world's coastal zones are associated with large and growing concentrations of population, urban development and economic activity. Among coastal environments, deltas have long been recognized for both benefits and hazards. This is particularly true on the Asian megadeltas, where the majority of the world's deltaic populations reside. Current trends in urban migration, combined with demographic momentum suggest that the already large populations on the Asian megadeltas will continue to grow. In this study, we combine recently released gridded population density (circa 2010) with a newly developed night light change product (1992 to 2012) and a digital elevation model to quantify the spatial distribution of population and development on the nine Asian megadeltas. Bivariate distributions of population as functions of elevation and coastal proximity quantify potential exposure of deltaic populations to flood and coastal hazards. Comparison of these distributions for the Asian megadeltas show very different patterns of habitation with peak population elevations ranging from 2 to 11 m above sea level over a wide range of coastal proximities. Over all nine megadeltas, over 174 million people reside below a peak population elevation of 7 m. Changes in the spatial extent of anthropogenic night light from 1992 to 2012 show widely varying extents and changes of lighted urban development. All of the deltas except the Indus show the greatest increases in night light brightness occurring at elevations < 10 m. At global and continental scales, growth of settlements of all sizes takes the form of evolving spatial networks of development. Spatial networks of lighted urban development in Asia show power law scaling properties consistent with other continents, but much higher rates of growth. The three largest networks of development in China all occur on deltas and adjacent lowlands, and are growing faster than the rest of the urban network in China. Since 2000, the Huanghe Delta + North China Plain urban network has surpassed the Japanese urban network in size and may soon connect with the Changjiang Delta + Yangtze River urban network to form the largest conurbation in Asia.

AB The adjustment of administrative divisions is one of the important factors guiding China's urbanization, which has profound economic and social effects for regional development. In this paper, we comprehensively describe the process of the adjustment of administrative divisions at provincial and municipal levels in China and summarize the effects on the basic structure and patterns of the spatial development. We quantitatively assess the effects on fields such as urbanization and social economy through the use of multidimensional scaling. The results show that: 1) Upgrading county to municipality (or city-governed district) is the main way of adjusting the administrative divisions. It is also an important factor in the spatial differentiation of interprovincial urbanization. China's population urbanization can be divided into four patterns including interprovincial migration, provincial migration, natural growth, and growth caused by the adjustment of administrative divisions, which is also the main reason for the increased Chinese urbanization rate at the provincial level. 2) Taking the city of Beijing as an example, we generalize five adjustment patterns made to administrative divisions: the set-up of sub-districts, the set-up of regional offices, the upgrading of townships to sub-districts, the upgrading of townships to towns, and the set-up of towns and the addition of new regional offices. We summarize the municipal urban spatial structure, including the sub-district office area in the central urban area, the regional office area in the new urban area, the mixed area of villages, towns, and sub-district offices in the suburb area, and the township area in the outer suburb area. 3) The adjustment of administrative divisions triggers a significant circulative accumulation effect, resulting in the spatial locking of population and industrial agglomeration. It affects the evolution of the urban spatial form and plays an important role in shaping the urban spatial structure to move to the characteristic of multicenter. In general, the adjustment of administrative divisions was an important factor affecting the inflated statistical level of urbanization and also an important driving force for the evolution of Chinese urban spatial organization structure.

AB The potential of scaling and corrosion in wells (Bahar plain, Iran) was studied during the years from 2004 to 2014. This study used the Langelier Saturation Index, Ryznar Stability Index and Puckorius Scaling Index to get the corrosion and scaling potential of water wells in Bahar plain for drinking, agricultural, industrial consumption, urban conveyance, and distribution pipes and used the Wilcox, Schoeller and Piper diagram for classifying the quality of water. Based on WHO guidelines the water samples were at the permissible limit for drinking water. The results of the Piper diagram showed that the water samples were classified into three water types of bicarbonate, calcium, and Ca-Mg-Na-K and the class of water were C2-S1 and C2-S2 using the Wilcox diagram. The mean value of the Langelier Saturation Index (LSI), Ryznar Stability Index (RSI) and Puckorius Scaling Index (PSI) was 0.18, 7.25 and 6.56 respectively. Based on the LSI index, 55.3% of the samples were low scale and the 80% and 46.1% of the samples were corrosive and low corrosive, respectively. The results indicated that the drinking and industrial consumption of the water of this plain need to be considered.

AB With the rapid economic development, water pollution has become a major concern in China. Understanding the spatial variation of urban wastewater discharge and measuring the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants are prerequisites for rationally designing schemes and infrastructures to control water pollution. Based on the input and output urban wastewater treatment data of the 31 provinces of mainland China for the period 2011-2015, the spatial variation of urban water pollution and the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants were measured and mapped. The exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) model and super-efficiency data envelopment analysis (DEA) combined Malmquist index were used to achieve this goal. The following insight was obtained from the results. (1) The intensity of urban wastewater discharge increased, and the urban wastewater discharge showed a spatial agglomeration trend for the period 2011 to 2015. (2) The average inefficiency of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) for the study period was 39.2%. The plants' efficiencies worsened from the eastern to western parts of the country. (3) The main reasons for the low efficiency were the lack of technological upgrade and scale-up. The technological upgrade rate was -4.8%, while the scale efficiency increases as a result of scaling up was -0.2%. Therefore, to improve the wastewater treatment efficiency of the country, the provinces should work together to increase capital investment and technological advancement.
