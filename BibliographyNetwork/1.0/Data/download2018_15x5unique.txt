AB The paper focuses on the impact generated by the un-efficient management of waste flows on both natural environment and urbanization process and on the opportunity to invert it by regenerating Wasted Landscapes, i.e. underused, polluted and abandoned sites, especially located in pen-urban areas. This is one of the aims of the REPAIR project funded in 2016 by the European Commission within the Horizon 2020 framework developed by University of Naples with TU Delft as Lead Partner. The implementation of multi-scaling/multi-disciplinary approach, for testing out collaborative decision-making, has seen so far the research of a scientific based definition of peri-urban area in the context of the Metropolitan Area of Naples. The selection of the pen-urban areas has also been tested through Living Labs, aimed at designing eco-innovative solutions towards circularity.

AB FSG is a mission-driven nonprofit organization supporting leaders in creating large-scale, lasting social change. A survey conducted by FSG in 2015 across 4407 low-income families in urban India showed that 95% of them send their children to preschools, a majority of choosing affordable private preschools (APSs), as parents perceive the quality of government schools to be poor. Parents use and value rote-based methods (e.g., reciting poems) to assess their children's learning in school; however, these methods fail to measure conceptual understanding. The APS system delivers on these rote approaches using inappropriate pedagogy, leading to poor learning outcomes. Affordable high-quality activity-based preschool solutions exist and could be brought to the APS to significantly improve the classroom environment and learning outcomes. This requires changing mindsets of all actors-solution provider companies, APS owners, APS teachers, and low-income parents. We present FSG's approach to shaping demand for quality preschool services and to improve learning outcomes in urban Indian APSs through the implementation of the pilot Program to Improve Private Early Education (PIPE).

AB Social sciences have an important challenge today to take advantage of new research opportunities provided by large amounts of data generated by online social networks. Because of its marketing value, sports clubs are also motivated in creating and maintaining a stable audience in social media. In this paper, we analyze followers of prominent footballs clubs on Twitter by obtaining their home locations. We then measure how city size is connected to the number of followers using the theory of urban scaling. The results show that the scaling exponents of club followers depend on the income of a country. These findings could be used to understand the structure and potential growth areas of global football audiences.

AB Hydrogeomorphic approaches for floodplain modelling are valuable tools for water resource and flood hazard management and mapping, especially as the global availability and accuracy of terrain data increases. Digital terrain models implicitly contain information about floodplain landscape morphology that was produced by hydrologic processes over long time periods, as well as recent anthropogenic modifications to floodplain features and processes. The increased availability of terrain data and distributed hydrologic datasets provide an opportunity to develop hydrogeomorphic floodplain delineation models that can quickly be applied at large spatial scales. This research investigates the performance of a hydrogeomorphic floodplain model in two large urbanized and gauged river basins in the United States, the Susquehanna and the Wabash basins. The models were calibrated by a hydrologic data scaling technique, implemented through regression analyses of USGS peak flow data to estimate floodplain flow levels across multiple spatial scales. Floodplain model performance was assessed through comparison with 100-year Federal Emergency Management Agency flood hazard maps. Results show that the hydrogeomorphic floodplain maps are generally consistent with standard flood maps, even when significantly and systematically varying scaling parameters within physically feasible ranges, with major differences that are likely due to infrastructure (levees, bridges, etc.) in highly urbanized areas and other locations where the geomorphic signature of fluvial processes has been altered. This study demonstrates the value of geomorphic information for large-scale floodplain mapping and the potential use of hydrogeomorphic models for evaluating human-made impacts to floodplain ecosystems and patterns of disconnectivity in urbanized catchments.

AB Chemical-based studies have shown pollution of rivers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. However, as bioassessment is not a component of the river assessment and monitoring programmes, information on the ecological status of the rivers is limited. The study assessed the ecological status of the Little and Greater Akaki Rivers using macroinvertebrates. Macroinvertebrates were collected from twelve sites twice in the dry and wet seasons. There was abundance of few tolerant, collector-gatherer taxa with a loss of most sensitive taxa that used to be part of the river systems. Macroinvertebrate communities from upper and lower reaches showed complete differentiation on the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination graph with upstream reaches composed of relatively sensitive taxa while the lower reaches dominated by tolerant taxa. Multiresponse permutation procedure (MRPP) showed significant difference between the two reaches. Macroinvertebrate communities from the dry and wet seasons did not show differentiation on the NMS ordination graph and MRPP did not show significant difference. Both rivers scored low in the South African Scoring System (SASS 5) and ETHbios, indicating ecological degradation. The results suggest that several decades of environmental degradation might have led to impoverished regional species pool, consisting mainly tolerant and generalist taxa constant throughout the year.
