AB The scientific measurement of land use in space is an essential task in urban agglomeration studies, and the fractal feature is one of the most powerful tools for describing the phenomenon of space. However, previous research on the fractal feature of land use has mostly been conducted in urban space, and examines the fractal feature of different land use types, respectively; thus, the measurement of the relationship between different land use types was not realized. Meanwhile, previous prediction methods used for spatial land use mostly relied on subjective abstraction of the evolution, theoretically, regardless of whether they were calibrated, so that complete coverage of all the mechanisms could not be guaranteed. Based on this, here, we treat the land use structure in urban agglomeration space as the research object, and attempt to establish a fractal measure method for the relationship between different land use types in the space of urban agglomeration. At the same time, we use the allometric relationship between entirety and local to establish an objective forecast model for the land use structure in urban agglomeration space based on gray prediction theory, to achieve a predictive measurement of the structure of land use in urban agglomeration space. Finally, this study applied the methods on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration to analyze the evolution of the stability of the structure of land use and achieve predictive measurement of the structure of land use. The results of the case study show that the methods proposed in this study can obtain the measurement of the relationship between different land use types and the land use prediction that does not depend on the subjective exploration of the evolution law. Compared with the measurement methods that analyzed the fractal feature of different land types, respectively, and the prediction methods that rely on subjective choice, the methods presented in this study recaps some innovations and reference values for relevant future research.

AB An increase in short duration precipitation extremes poses challenges for storm water design in rapidly urbanizing India. The recent Paris Agreement aims to limit the global mean temperature (GMT) below 1.5 degrees C (and possibly below 2.0 degrees C) from the preindustrial level. However, the changes in subdaily precipitation extremes in India remain unrecognized under the 1.5- and 2.0-degrees C temperature targets. Here using observations and projections of the subdaily precipitation, we show that a majority (11 out of 15) of General Circulation Models underestimate 3-hourly precipitation extremes and overestimate the relationship between 3-hourly precipitation extremes and GMT (scaling) in India. A rise of 1.5 (2.0 degrees C) in GMT from the preindustrial level is projected to cause 20% (25%) increase in 3-hourly precipitation maxima at 100-year return period under the stationary condition, which can further rise by 10% under the nonstationary condition. Projected warming results in a much faster (almost twice) increase in 3-hourly precipitation maxima than 24-hourly 100-year precipitation maxima. Moreover, 3-hourly 100-year precipitation maxima are projected to increase significantly at 78 locations (out of 89) if GMT increases from 1.5 to 2.0 degrees C from the preindustrial level. Our findings have implications for urban storm water designs in India.

AB Background: Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a brief multicomponent intervention incorporating behavioral strategies delivered by lay health workers. The effectiveness of PM+ has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials in Kenya and Pakistan. When developing interventions for large-scale implementation it is considered essential to evaluate their feasibility and acceptability in addition to their efficacy. This paper discusses a qualitative evaluation of PM+ for women affected by adversity in Kenya.
   Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 key informants from peri-urban Nairobi, Kenya, where PM+ was tested. Interview participants included six women who completed PM+, six community health volunteers (CHVs) who delivered the intervention, seven people with local decision making power, and eight project staff involved in the PM+ trial.
   Results: Key informants generally noted positive experiences with PM+. Participants and CHVs reported the positive impact PM+ had made on their lives. Nonetheless, potential structural and psychological barriers to scale up were identified. The sustainability of CHVs as unsalaried, volunteer providers was mentioned by most interviewees as the main barrier to scaling up the intervention.
   Conclusions: The findings across diverse stakeholders show that PM+ is largely acceptable in this Kenyan setting. The results indicated that when further implemented, PM+ could be of great value to people in communities exposed to adversities such as interpersonal violence and chronic poverty. Barriers to large-scale implementation were identified, of which the sustainability of the non-specialist health workforce was the most important one.

TI Prevalence of antigliadin IgA antibodies in psoriasis vulgaris and

AB Introduction: The course of psoriasis relies on a variety of metabolic and immunological parameters. Identification of underlying pro-inflammatory conditions and their control is desired for optimal management.
   Background: Increased prevalence of serum markers for celiac disease has been reported among patients with psoriasis. The likelihood of occult celiac disease in a subpopulation of patients has been postulated and gluten-free diets have been reported to be effective.
   Patients and methods: The prevalence of gliadin IgA antibodies was assessed among patients with psoriasis in an urban population. The clinical effects of a strict gluten-free diet were followed.
   Results: Over a 2-year period, 97 patients with Psoriasis Area and Severity Index greater than 2.4 were recruited from a population followed in a dermatology clinic. Gliadin IgA antibodies were assessed in all participants and in 91 controls. Elevated gliadin IgA antibodies were found in 13 patients (14%) and two controls (2%). Values in five patients were assessed as greater than 30.0 U/mL or "strong positive" according to the manufacturer of the assay. All 13 patients were placed on a strict gluten-free diet without any other modifications in their ongoing treatment of psoriasis. Improvement of psoriatic lesions was observed in all patients with positive gliadin IgA antibodies but the decline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score and the scaling down of pharmaceutical treatment was more pronounced in the five patients with strong positive gliadin IgA indicating an immune aberration amenable to diet changes.
   Conclusion: Prevalence of antigliadin IgA antibody is significant among patients with psoriasis not diagnosed with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity. For all its limitations, antigliadin IgA testing can identify patients likely to benefit from gluten-free diets.

AB This article presents an investigation on the perception of captive and choice riders for formulating service standards of ordinary and premium buses in Indian cities. The level of service standards were defined using Law of Successive Interval Scaling based on data collected from 2000 travelers in Kolkata city. As premium and ordinary bus services are predominantly used by choice riders (private car owners) and captive riders (non-car owners) respectively, LOS standards of these two services were defined based on the perception of choice and captive riders. The result shows a substantial difference in the perception of captive and choice riders which justifies the need for having distinct service standards for ordinary and premium services. The study also evaluated the level of service of a few premium and ordinary routes based on the developed service standards. The evaluation indicated that while the premium buses are introduced to attract the choice riders, a majority of them are operating below the expected service levels and thus, unable to fulfil the requirements of choice riders. The LOS standards developed in the present work may be used judiciously by the transit planners and service providers for improvement of premium and ordinary bus service in Kolkata city. Although the level of service standards developed in the present work are city specific, the work is of interest to the policy makers of public transport as several emerging countries are experiencing rapid urbanization and public transport has to play a dual role to serve the mobility needs of marginally weaker segments (captive riders) and act as a demand management instrument to attract choice riders.
