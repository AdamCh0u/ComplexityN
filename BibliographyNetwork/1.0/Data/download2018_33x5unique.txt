AB Despite the importance of subdaily precipitation extremes for urban areas, the role of dynamic and thermodynamic scaling in changes in precipitation extremes in India remains poorly constrained. Here we estimate contributions from thermodynamic and dynamic scaling on changes in subdaily precipitation extremes for 23 urban locations in India. Subdaily precipitation extremes have become more intense during the last few decades. Moreover, we find a twofold rise in the frequency of subdaily precipitation extremes during 1979-2015, which is faster than the increase in daily precipitation extremes. The contribution of dynamic scaling in this rise in the frequency and intensity of subdaily precipitation extremes is higher than the thermodynamic scaling. Moreover, half-hourly precipitation extremes show higher contributions from the both thermodynamic (similar to 10%/K) and dynamic (similar to 15%/K) scaling than daily (6%/K and 9%/K, respectively) extremes indicating the role of warming on the rise in the subdaily precipitation extremes in India. Our findings have implications for better understanding the dynamic response of precipitation extremes under the warming climate over India.
   Plain Language Summary Understanding the changes in precipitation extremes in urban areas with warming climate can be valuable in mitigating the adverse social and financial consequences. India has witnessed a twofold rise in the frequency of subdaily precipitation extremes during 1979-2015. This increase in the subdaily frequency of extreme precipitation events is higher than the frequency of daily precipitation extremes. Urban areas in India witness flooding due to increasing extreme precipitation events, which caused enormous damage to infrastructure. Despite the increase in subdaily extreme precipitation in India, the contribution of thermodynamic and dynamic scaling remains largely unexplored. We show that subdaily precipitation extremes have substantially larger contribution from thermodynamic and dynamic scaling than that of daily precipitation extremes. We find that subdaily precipitation extremes are more strongly related to changes in variations in the atmospheric motion and increase in vertical velocity than the rise in atmospheric moisture content. Our work will help in understanding the subdaily precipitation extremes in India under the warming climate.

TI Analysis and modelling of surface Urban Heat Island in 20 Canadian
   cities under climate and land-cover change

AB Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) is an urban climate phenomenon that is expected to respond to future climate and land-use land-cover change. It is important to further our understanding of physical mechanisms that govern SUHI phenomenon to enhance our ability to model future SUHI characteristics under changing geophysical conditions. In this study, SUHI phenomenon is quantified and modelled at 20 cities distributed across Canada. By analyzing MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensed surface temperature at the cities over 2002-2012, it is found that 16 out of 20 selected cities have experienced a positive SUHI phenomenon while 4 cities located in the prairies region and high elevation locations have experienced a negative SUHI phenomenon in the past. A statistically significant relationship between observed SUHI magnitude and city elevation is also recorded over the observational period. A Physical Scaling downscaling model is then validated and used to downscale future surface temperature projections from 3 GCMs and 2 extreme Representative Concentration Pathways in the urban and rural areas of the cities. Future changes in SUHI magnitudes between historical (2006-2015) and future timelines: 2030s (2026-2035), 2050s (2046-2055), and 2090s (2091-2100) are estimated. Analysis of future projected changes indicate that 15 (13) out of 20 cities can be expected to experience increases in SUHI magnitudes in future under RCP 2.6 (RCP 8.5). A statistically significant relationship between projected future SUHI change and current size of the cities is also obtained. The study highlights the role of city properties (i.e. its size, elevation, and surrounding land cover) towards shaping their current and future SUHI characteristics. The results from this analysis will help decision-makers to manage Canadian cities more efficiently under rapidly changing geophysical and demographical conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Background: Despite safe and effective childhood immunizations, decreased acceptance of vaccines has become an emerging global problem. The WHO SAGE Working Group on Vaccine Hesitancy developed a common diagnostic tool, the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale (VHS), to identify and compare hesitancy in different global settings. We field tested the VHS in rural and urban Guatemala.
   Methods: We analyzed data from the enrollment visit of a study conducted at four public health clinics in Guatemala. Infants ages 6 weeks-6 months presenting for their first wellness visit were enrolled March-November 2016. Parents completed a demographic survey that included the 10 dichotomous and 10 Likert scale VHS questions. Chi-square or Fisher's exact for categorical and ANOVA test for continuous variables were used to assess significance levels in survey differences. We conducted a factor analysis to assess the Likert scale questions.
   Results: Of 1088 families screened, 871 were eligible and 720 (82.7%) participated. No parent had ever refused a vaccination, and only eight parents (1.1%) had been reluctant or hesitated to get a vaccination for their children. However, only 40.8% (n = 294) of parents said that they think most parents like them have their children vaccinated with all the recommended vaccines. Factor analysis identified two underlying constructs that had eigenvalues of 1.0 or greater and a substantive lack of variability in response across the Likert scale. There were consistent differences between how study clinics responded to the ordinal scaling.
   Conclusion: Our results suggest problems with interpretation of the VHS, especially in the presence of vaccine shortages and using a Likert scale that does not resonate across diverse cultural settings. Our factor analysis suggests that the Likert scale items are more one-dimensional and do not represent the multiple constructs of vaccine hesitancy. We suggest more work is needed to refine this survey for improved reliability and validity. (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI Entropy in peri-urbanization: inequality n access to transport
   infrastructures in Tonala, Mexico
SO URBE-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GESTAO URBANA
LA Spanish
DT Article
DE Entropy; Transport infrastructure; Inequality
AB Mobility in the peri-urban strips has been experiencing multifaceted allometric growth, manifested in infrastructures for primarily motorized transport systems, which are characterized by obvious transformations and morphological configurations that converge with the entropy in the city system. Although this is not exclusive of peripheries, this is where deficiencies and inadequacies for some are intensified and recalcitrant improvements for others. This paper reviews the physical conditions and access to mobility infrastructures in the southeast o f the municipality of Tonalci, Jalisco-Mexico. From a system approach, we performed a quasi-ethnographic exercise aided by photographic records and satellite images. The results suggest that the urban-territorial planning process is inequitable and does not represent the negentropic force necessary to regulate the thermodynamics related to the exercise of living the city. In other words, there has been a lack of systemic conception in the planning process, originating excessive costs and time in the peri-urban mobility.

AB River networks play a key role in the spatial organization of human settlements. Both river networks and human settlements have been found to exhibit regular self-similar patterns, but little is known about the generalized spatial patterns of human settlements embedded within river networks. Here based on night light data, we find a universal fractal structure at the global scale, with both robust Hortonian scaling relationships with the extent of human settlements and statistically significant power law scaling of the power spectra of human area functions. Globally, we find consistent patterns of power law preferential downstream clustering of human settlements across all six populated continents, typically up to 40% of the maximum flow length. This downstream clustering suggests an optimum distribution of humans in large river basins for trade, transport, and natural resource utilization but with attendant implications for human impacts on rivers. Recognition of such spatial patterns helps generalize assessments of human impacts on rivers, with direct implications for management of water quality and biological diversity in river networks.
