AB One type of fractal dimension definition is based on the generalized entropy function. Both entropy and fractal dimensions can be employed to characterize complex spatial systems such as cities and regions. Despite the inherent connection between entropy and fractal dimensions, they have different application scopes and directions in urban studies. This paper focuses on exploring how to convert entropy measurements into fractal dimensions for the spatial analysis of scale-free urban phenomena using the ideas from scaling. Urban systems proved to be random prefractal and multifractal systems. The spatial entropy of fractal cities bears two properties. One is the scale dependence: the entropy values of urban systems always depend on the linear scales of spatial measurement. The other is entropy conservation: different fractal parts bear the same entropy value. Thus, entropy cannot reflect the simple rules of urban processes and the spatial heterogeneity of urban patterns. If we convert the generalized entropies into multifractal spectrums, the problems of scale dependence and entropy homogeneity can be solved to a degree for urban spatial analysis. Especially, the geographical analyses of urban evolution can be simplified. This study may be helpful for students in describing and explaining the spatial complexity of urban evolution.

AB This study aimed to determine the parameters of scaling and corrosion potential of drinking water in sources and distribution networks of water supply in two cities of north of Iran. The results of Amlash water sampels analysis in winter revealed that the average values of Langelier, Ryznar, Aggressive, Pockorius, and Larson- skold indices was -1.31, 9.73, 11.5, 9.74 and 0.24, respectively, but, in summer they were -1.51, 10.71, 11.36, 10.72 and 0.25, respectively. For Rudsar, the results of water sampels analysis in winter illustrated that the average values of Langelier, Ryznar, Aggressive, Pockorius, and Larson was -1.12, 9.69, 11.33, 9.19 and 0.16, respectively, while, in summer they were -1.05, 10.04, 11.92, 10.18 and 0.19, respectively. The beneficial of this data is showing the clear image of drinking water quality and can be useful for preventing the economical and safety problems relating to corrosion and scaling of drinking water.

AB Purpose The purpose of this research work is to design and apply LabVIEW in the area of traffic maintenance and flow, by introducing improvements in the smart city. The objective is to introduce the automated human-machine interface (HMI) - a computer-based graphical user interface (GUI) - for measuring the traffic flow and detecting faults in poles.
   Design/methodology/approach This research paper is based on the use of LabVIEW for designing the HMI for a traffic system in a smart city. This includes considerable measures that are: smart flow of traffic, violation detection on the signal, fault measurement in the traffic pole, locking down of cars for emergency and measuring parameters inside the cars.
   Findings In this paper, the GUIs and the required circuitry for making improvements in the infrastructure of traffic systems have been designed and proposed, with their respective required hardware. Several measured conditions have been discussed in detail.
   Research limitations/implications PJRC Teensy 3.1 has been used because it contains enough general-purpose input-output (GPIO) pins required for monitoring parameters that are used for maintaining the necessary flow of traffic and monitor the proposed study case. A combination of sensors such as infrared, accelerometer, magnetic compass, temperature sensor, current sensors, ultrasonic sensor, fingerprint readers, etc. are used to create a monitoring environment for the application. Using Teensy and LabVIEW, the system costs less and is effective in terms of performance.
   Practical implications The microprocessor board shields for placing actuators and sensors and for attaching the input/output (I/O) to the LED indicators and display have been designed. A circuitry for scaling voltage, i.e. making sensor readings to read limits, has been designed. A combination of certain sensors, at different signals, will lead to a secure and more durable control of traffic. The proposed applications with its hardware and software cost less, are effective and can be easily used for making the city's traffic services smart. For alarm levels, the desired alarm level can be set from the front panel for certain conditions from the monitoring station. For this, virtual channels can be created for allowing the operator to set any random value for limits. If the sensor value crosses the alarm value, then the corresponding alarm displays an alert. The system works by using efficient decision-making techniques and stores the data along with the corresponding time of operation, for future decisions.
   Originality/value This study is an advanced research of its category because it combines the field of electrical engineering, computer science and traffic systems by using LabVIEW.

AB Sustaining ecosystem services (ES), mitigating their tradeoffs and avoiding unfavorable future trajectories are pressing social-environmental challenges that require enhanced understanding of their relationships across scales. Current knowledge of ES relationships is often constrained to one spatial scale or one snapshot in time. In this research, we integrated biophysical modeling with future scenarios to examine changes in relationships among eight ES indicators from 2001-2070 across three spatial scales-grid cell, subwatershed, and watershed. We focused on the Yahara Watershed (Wisconsin) in the Midwestern United States-an exemplar for many urbanizing agricultural landscapes. Relationships among ES indicators changed over time; some relationships exhibited high interannual variations (e.g. drainage vs. food production, nitrate leaching vs. net ecosystem exchange) and even reversed signs over time (e.g. perennial grass production vs. phosphorus yield). Robust patterns were detected for relationships among some regulating services (e.g. soil retention vs. water quality) across three spatial scales, but other relationships lacked simple scaling rules. This was especially true for relationships of food production vs. water quality, and drainage vs. number of days with runoff > 10 mm, which differed substantially across spatial scales. Our results also showed that local tradeoffs between food production and water quality do not necessarily scale up, so reducing local tradeoffs may be insufficient to mitigate such tradeoffs at the watershed scale. We further synthesized these cross-scale patterns into a typology of factors that could drive changes in ES relationships across scales: (1) effects of biophysical connections, (2) effects of dominant drivers, (3) combined effects of biophysical linkages and dominant drivers, and (4) artificial scale effects, and concluded with management implications. Our study highlights the importance of taking a dynamic perspective and accounting for spatial scales in monitoring and management to sustain future ES.

DE Anonymization; Privacy Preserve Trajectories; Population distribution
AB Growing mobile networks and widely spread of Global Positing System (GPS) devices enables to collect large scale location and trajectory data. Using trajectory data to succeed, privacy and data characteristics are essential. Most anonymization methods are losing characteristic for service providers, like adding noise to trajectories.
   In this paper, firstly we present adaptive quadtree grid population calculation to determine grid size of trajectories.
   Our anonymization method dynamically adjust cluster size to maintain trajectory data characteristics, small mesh to the dense populated area, large mesh to sparse populated area, base on quadtree geospatial data structure.
   Proposed method is satisfied that adaptive size scaling and more efficient to maintain characteristic. Our experiment suggest that proposed method correctly anonymize Tokyo Urban flow data of 1.3M Trajectories.
