AB Population loss in North America is often viewed as a problem best addressed through economic development efforts promoting growth. In Europe, an alternative view sees depopulation as a process needing to be managed properly, by scaling down community services and infrastructure while maintaining social equity. Called smart shrinkage, this approach argues places can lose population yet still possess a high quality of life. We first clarify the concept by distinguishing the outputs of smartness from its inputs using the entrepreneurial social infrastructure framework. Second, we apply the smart shrinkage concept to n = 98 small towns in the Midwestern state of Iowa using longitudinal data collected in 1994 and 2014. Shrinkage is measured by faster than average population loss; and smart outcomes by faster than average quality of life gains. We then examine correlates of smart shrinkage using demographic, economic, social capital, and civic engagement indicators. Demographic and geographic factors have little impact on smart shrinkage. Smart towns have stronger local labor markets, lower poverty and inequality, and job opportunities in goods-producing sectors. Lastly, smart shrinking towns exhibit higher social infrastructure by possessing more bridging social capital across diverse groups, greater quantities of linking social capital such as memberships in local organizations, and frequent civic engagement by participation in local projects. These activities are supported by a community culture of openness, tolerance, and support.

AB The Oak Gulch green infrastructure (GI) planning and design project was initiated by the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District (UDFCD) in 2016 to provide a holistic assessment of the potential to develop a watershed in the southeastern metropolitan area using the principles of GI and low impact development (LID) through the earliest planning stages to design and through implementation. UDFCD assembled a project team of planners, civil engineers, water engineers, landscape architects, geomorphologists, and other specialists to fully evaluate the potential for minimizing changes in hydrology and water quality as a result of development. The project has involved development of multiple site grading plans to evaluate economic viability of development strategies from traditional development to full implementation of LID/GI, identification of barriers to implementation of GI/LID, and analysis of hydrologic changes and stormwater controls from the lot scale to the watershed scale using SWMM on an event and continuous basis. LID and GI practices were developed at lot, block, subcatchment, and watershed scales. Key practices included disconnecting impervious area, accounting for infiltration in pervious conveyances, and distributed full spectrum detention. This paper focuses on the hydrology and modeling aspects of this project, including discussion of scaling and continuity issues at different temporal and spatial scales from the lot level to the watershed level. The modeling approach used is capable of spanning multiple scales, and the paper briefly discusses surrogate modeling techniques that allow for accounting of lot and block scale infiltration practices at a larger, subcatchment scale.

AB This study aims to characterize the performance of a 150 L bioelectrochemical system-based plant, during the simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal from several waste streams of wastewater treatment plants. The bioelectrochemical system (BES) contained five electrode pairs (operated hydraulically and electrically in parallel) and was fed with either wastewater, centrate (nutrient-rich liquid stream produced during the dewatering of digested biomass), or a mixture of both over 63 days, with a hydraulic retention time of one day. Total organic carbon and total nitrogen removal rates averaged 80% and 70%, respectively, with a specific energy consumption of 0.18 kWh.m(-3) (BES + ancillary equipment). This work also underlines the challenges of using BES for nitrogen removal, highlighting the limitations of the current design, and suggesting some strategies for improvement.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate the factors which can cause inequality of opportunity in education in Turkey through the law of rank order judgement on the basis of academicians' views. The research was a quantitative descriptive study, which was carried out with 102 academicians. In the research, a data collection tool was used which consisted of the questions aimed at determining demographics of the participants, and factors that could lead to inequality of opportunity in education. The participants were asked to rank the variables of gender, socio-economic level, place of residence, geographical region, disability, religion and belief, ethnicity, native language, the number of children in a family, parents' characteristics and technological possibilities individuals have from the highest to the lowest potential to cause inequality of opportunity in education beginning with 1 until 11. The data collected in this study were analyzed by using the method of rank order judgement scaling. In consequence, it was found that academicians considered the socio-economic level as the most important factor causing inequality of opportunity in education in Turkey, which was followed by the place of residence (rural-urban areas), parents' characteristics, disability, geographical region, native language, gender, the number of children in a family, technological possibilities individuals have, religion and belief, and ethnicity respectively.

AB The increasing energy demand stimulates the increase of the natural-gas-transmitting pipelines all around China and provokes serious fire risks as a result of accidental pipeline breaks and gas leakage, especially in cities at different altitudes. This work concerns the pressure effect on the flame height of buoyant jet diffusion flames restricted by parallel sidewalls in a reduced pressure, which does exist in natural gas leakage fire accidents in high-plateau areas. Experiments were conducted in Lhasa, Tibet, China (altitude, 3650 m; pressure, 0.64 atm), and the corresponding comparison results conducted in a normal pressure are referred from our previous work obtained in Hefei, Anhui, China (altitude, 50 m; pressure, 1.0 atm). The evolution of the flame heights of buoyant jet diffusion flames restricted by parallel sidewalls in a reduced pressure are examined, and the major new findings are that the evolution of a parabolic uprising buoyant vortex at the flame boundary and the flame heights vary much like that in a normal pressure as the sidewall separation distance increases from the minimum value. Moreover, the flame height in a reduced pressure is found to be slightly higher than that in a normal pressure, implying that a wider range of areas will be dangerous as a result of larger flames and exposure distances to radiation fluxes. The critical sidewall separation distance (S-cri) in a reduced pressure is figured out and correlated with the model obtained from our previous scaling analysis. Besides, it is found that, in a reduced pressure, the critical separation distance in a reduced pressure is slightly wider than that in a normal pressure, indicating that the surroundings should be located further to reduce fire risks. Finally, a global correlation accounting for the pressure effect based on the proposed model to characterize the variation of the flame height is obtained, correlating the experimental results in both reduced and normal pressures with good agreement. The current work can not only provide some supplemental knowledge on gas leakage flames restricted by surroundings in both reduced and normal pressures but also serve as a scientific basis to the management on the gas fuel energy storage and transportation systems in the cities at different altitudes to reduce possible fire threat.
