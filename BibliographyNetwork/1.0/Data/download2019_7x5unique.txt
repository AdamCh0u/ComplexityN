AB Based on the analysis of the field traffic flow time series, we found that there is self-similarity and periodic similarity in the traffic flow of different observation scales, which makes the short-term traffic flow prediction a meaningful work. For the purpose of finding the smallest prediction cycle, fractal analysis was conducted in the relation between the observation scale and the prediction cycle by using both the field data and the simulated data. We calculate the fractal dimension and the scaling region of traffic flow time series by using the G-P algorithm. If the scaling region can be found in the traffic flow time series at some observation scale, it means that there is self-similarity in the time series at that observation scale. The minimum observation scale at which there is self-similarity in the traffic flow is the smallest prediction cycle. This observation scale is a prerequisite for judging whether the traffic flow can be predicted or not. This research provides a reference for the short-term traffic flow prediction on expressway and urban road.

AB Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant health concern rooted in community experiences and other social determinants. The purpose of this study is to understand community-based risk and protective factors of IPV perpetration through participatory research that engages men who use IPV. Secondarily, we assess the relative influence, as measured by ranking, of these factors regarding risk of IPV perpetration and stress. We conducted concept mapping with Baltimore men (n=28), ages 18 and older, enrolled in an abuse intervention program (AIP), through partnership with a domestic violence agency. Concept mapping, a three-phase participatory process, generates ideas around an issue then visually presents impactful domains via multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering. Most participants were Black (87.5%) and 20-39years old (75%). Seven key domains, or clusters, were established. No hope for the future was the greatest contributor to IPV perpetration. Socioeconomic struggles (i.e., lack of employment) and life in Baltimore (i.e., homicide) were most likely to result in stress. Emergent domains related to IPV perpetration and stress were ranked similarly, but with some nuance. Having good support systems (i.e., family, community centers) were felt to prevent IPV and reduce stress. This participant-driven process among a primarily young, Black sample of Baltimore men speaks to the influence of perceived social disempowerment and underlying trauma on intimate relationships and the potential for mitigation. Few studies have engaged men who use IPV through participatory research to understand the comprehensive dynamics of an impoverished, urban environment. Results provide direction for community-based intervention and prevention programming to increase self-efficacy, particularly among younger men, and to enact trauma-informed violence prevention policy from the perspectives of male IPV perpetrators.
